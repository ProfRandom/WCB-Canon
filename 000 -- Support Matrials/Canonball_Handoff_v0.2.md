# 🎯 Canonball Handoff Protocol v0.2 — Worlds by the Numbers
*Supersedes v0.1*

A streamlined boilerplate prompt for transferring canonized material from a side-instance of ChatGPT into the Master Glossary Thread (control tower).  

---

## 📌 Usage
Paste this into a side conversation when you reach a *canonizable* stage on a specific topic.  
The side-instance will then prepare a Markdown export bundle for integration.

## 📝 Canonball Handoff Prompt

I am now ready to integrate the work we’ve done in this conversation regarding **[insert specific topic here]** into the **Master Glossary Thread** (the control tower).

Please do the following:

1. **Synopsize** the relevant parts of this discussion relating to **[topic]** in a structured way, focusing only on canonical decisions and glossary-worthy developments.  
2. **Collate firm decisions** we established (e.g., new glossary entries, symbol adoptions, framework rules, deprecations).  
3. **Generate a Markdown export file** that provides a brief cover note at the top (e.g., *“Handoff from Side Thread on [topic], dated [date]”*).  
4. Do **not** attempt to update the Master Glossary or Master Thread Index yourself. The Master instance will handle integration — your job is to prepare the bundle.

## 📌 Notes
- This protocol keeps side-instances focused on **content capture**, not filing.  
- The Master instance acts as **navigator, collaborator, and chronicler** — ensuring all canon is integrated consistently and meaningfully.  
- Nickname: **Canonball Handoff** — a direct shot from exploration to canonization.
