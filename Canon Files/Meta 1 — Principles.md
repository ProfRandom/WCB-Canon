# Mononic and Morphological Axes  

## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Establishes a hierarchical classification of **mononic morphotypes**: monon categories defined by gravitational rounding, fusion status, and structural physics.  
- Categories:  
  - **Planemon [sci]:** gravitationally rounded body, no fusion; includes dwarf planets and large moons.  
  - **Intermon [NEW]:** transitional-mass bodies between planemos and stars; may fuse deuterium (brown dwarfs).  
  - **Stellamon [sci/neo]:** hydrogen-fusing stars; foundational stellar monons.  
  - **Supermon [EXPANDED]:** high-mass stellar remnants (e.g., black holes, neutron stars) beyond stellamo scale but sub-galactic.  
  - **Ultramon [EXPANDED]:** supermassive objects (SMBHs) in galactic centers, 10‚Å∂‚Äì10‚Åπ ‚®Å.  
  - **Hypermon [EXPANDED]:** speculative hypermassive monons (>10‚Åπ ‚®Å), e.g. primordial collapses.  
- Provides a summary grid of categories, prefixes, abbreviations, and mass ranges (in Earth masses).  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Planemon [sci].**  
- **Intermon [NEW].**  
- **Stellamon [sci/neo].**  
- **Supermon [EXPANDED].**  
- **Ultramon [EXPANDED].**  
- **Hypermon [EXPANDED].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- **Planemon, Stellamon** already appear in canon.  
- **Supermon, Ultramon, Hypermon** existed in mass interval tables, but this file adds full narrative definitions.  
- **Intermon** is a new introduction.  
- **Status:** [EXPANDED + NEW] ‚Äî consolidates the mononic classification scheme; introduces Intermon

All physical bodies (*monons*) in the WCB framework are described along two orthogonal axes:  
their **Mononic class**, which defines scale and self-coherence,  
and their **Morphological character**, which defines material composition and structure.  
A third, contextual layer ‚Äî the **Categorical Envelope** ‚Äî arises from the interaction of the two.

| **Axis**                                 | **Defines**                                                      | **Typical Examples**                                 | **Field of Study** |
| :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Mononic (Vertical)**                   | Scale / mass domain ‚Äî the degree of self-coherence under gravity | micromon ‚Üí minimon ‚Üí planemon ‚Üí stellamon ‚Üí ultramon | **Mononics**       |
| **Morphological (Horizontal)**           | Material / structural composition ‚Äî what the body is made of     | lithic, rheatic, hydruric, cryic, metalluric         | **Morphology**     |
| **Categorical / Environmental Envelope** | Contextual synthesis of Mononic class + dominant Morphotype      | geotic, telluric, rheatic, xenotic                   | ‚Äî                  |

### Examples
- **Earth:** lithic planemon ‚Üí *geotic* category.  
- **Jupiter:** rheatic planemon ‚Üí *rheatic* category.  
- **Ceres:** hydruric minimon ‚Üí *asteroidal* category.  

### Definitions
- **Morphotype [neo]:** the primary compositional descriptor of a monon ‚Äî its dominant physical ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù or structural character (e.g., *lithic*, *rheatic*, *hydruric*).  
- **Category / Envelope [meta]:** an emergent classification expressing systemic context and behavior, derived from the combination of a monon‚Äôs mass domain and its morphotype (e.g., *geotic*, *telluric*, *xenotic*).  

> **Summary:**  
> The *Mononic axis* quantifies ‚Äî how massive and self-coherent a body is.  
> The *Morphological axis* qualifies ‚Äî what the body is made of.  
> The *Categorical envelope* contextualizes ‚Äî how those traits express within a stellar system.

# The Anthropic Norm



**Major Topics:**  
- Defines the **Anthropic Norm**: the universe and its functioning as presently perceived, absent extreme or rare conditions.  
- Closely tied to the **Mediocritic Principle of State**:  
  - The majority of matter and energy in the current epoch exists within a **statistically dominant modal band** of states.  
  - Extreme states (e.g., black holes, neutronium, degenerate matter) may be numerous but are **exceptions**, not norm-defining.  
- Key insights for worldbuilding:  
  1. **Rarity ‚â† Normativity**: unusual states, even if interesting, should not define the baseline.  
  2. **Normativity = Modal, not Mean**: the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù universe is not the statistical average, but the modal cluster where most matter/energy exists most of the time.  
- Examples:  
  - The universe is filled with stars, but is not ‚Äúmostly plasma‚Äù under current conditions.  
  - Neutron stars exist, but the cosmos is not composed of neutronium.  
  - Rocky planemos form from volatiles, but the universe remains overwhelmingly hydrogen and helium gas.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Anthropic Norm [NEW].**  
- **Mediocritic Principle of State [NEW].**  
- **Modal Cluster [sci].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- No prior mention of these terms in canon; both are newly introduced philosophical-structural concepts.  
- Complements existing WCB philosophical principles (e.g., Protagorean Principle).  
- **Status:** [NEW] ‚Äî establishes a normative philosophical baseline for worldbuilding.  


The universe and its functioning as we currently perceive it, absent any extreme conditions.

### The Anthropic Norm & the Mediocritic Principle of State

> The vast majority of matter and energy in the universe exists within a narrow, statistically dominant band of physical states ‚Äî  from which it deviates only rarely and locally, within the current cosmological epoch.

This leads to two foundational insights for thesiastic modeling:
1. **Rarity is not normativity.**  
    Extreme states ‚Äî from black holes to degenerate matter ‚Äî may be _numerous_, but they are not **norm-defining**. They are **local exceptions** to a global pattern.    
2. **Normativity is modal, not mean.**  
    The Anthropic Norm does not lie at the statistical _average_, but at the **modal cluster**:  
    the zone in which **most matter and energy exist most of the time** under current universal conditions.
Thus:
- The universe is filled with stars, but is mostly _not_ plasma.  
    _(It was **at one time** ‚Äî but that was a different epoch.)_    
- Neutron stars are real, but the universe is _not_ mostly neutronium.    
- Volatiles can form rocky planemons ‚Äî but the cosmos is _overwhelmingly_ hydrogen and helium in gaseous form.



# üîë The SANC Principle

## Abstract
**Major Topics:**  
- Definition of the **SANC Principle** (*Science-Adjacent, No Calculus*).  
- Scope of mathematical tools for WCB: algebra, geometry, trigonometry.  
- Exclusion of higher-level tools: calculus, tensors, advanced astrophysics.  
- Guiding philosophy: ‚ÄúRigor without rigidity.‚Äù  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- SANC = Science-Adjacent, No Calculus.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Canon as of Glossary v1.212.  
- Reinforces the methodological boundaries of WCB ‚Äî mathematical accessibility for builders without requiring advanced formal training.  
- Companion mottos: *Simple, Approximate, Notationally Clear* and *Sufficient and Necessary Constructs*.  


**SANC = Science-Adjacent, No Calculus.**

- ‚úÖ We use **algebra, geometry, and trigonometry** ‚Äî the practical tools any builder can wield.  
- üö´ We skip **calculus, tensors, and full astrophysics** ‚Äî that‚Äôs outside our scope.  
- üéØ Goal: **Rigor without rigidity.** Enough math to make worlds believable, never so much that it strangles imagination.  

*Think of SANC as your worldmaking passport: it gets you everywhere you need to go,  
but it won‚Äôt weigh you down with equations better left to astrophysicists.*
