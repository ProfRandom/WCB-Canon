### 🔑 Core Insight:

> **Habitability is shaped by _exposed land_, not just crustal proportion.**

A planemo might have:

- The **same total volume of felsic crust** as Earth,    
- The **same hydrospheric volume**,    
- But **very different levels of exposed land**, depending on:
    
    - Sea level (absolute and relative)        
    - Crustal relief        
    - Tectonic activity        
    - Isostatic balance

- **Continents ≠ dry land** — “continent” in geologic terms just means _buoyant crust_, not _exposed crust_.
- **Flooded cratons** were common for the first half of Earth’s history.    
- True **emergent landmasses** may have been small islands or microcontinents for much of the Archean and Paleoproterozoic.    
- **Modern-style continents** with wide uplands, deep interiors, and stable exposure are a **Phanerozoic phenomenon**.

### 🔹 What “New Crust” Really Means

When we say:

> “New crust is being created at mid-ocean ridges,”  
> we mean **oceanic crust** — specifically **mafic** basaltic crust — is forming as mantle material rises and cools.

But:

- This crust is **dense** and **thin** (≈ 7 km thick vs. ≈ ⟨30 ∧ 70⟩ km for continental crust).    
- It **sits lower** in the gravitational field — forming **ocean basins**, not continents.    
- It does **not increase exposed land area**, unless...    
    - It’s **uplifted** by tectonic collisions (forming island arcs, terranes)        
    - Or accreted onto existing **continental margins**
### 🔸 So:

> 🔍 **Oceanic crust = dynamic but low-lying**  
> 🪨 **Continental crust = buoyant and persistent**

In fact, over time:

- Oceanic crust is **recycled** back into the mantle via subduction (lifespan: ~200 My)    
- Continental crust tends to **accumulate and endure**, occasionally resurfacing in exposed terranes.

### 🪨 Is Felsic Crust Ever Subducted?

**Yes... but reluctantly.**  
Felsic (continental) crust **can** be pulled into a subduction zone — but:

- It is **less dense** than oceanic crust (≈ 2.7 g/cm³ vs ≈ 3.0+ g/cm³)    
- It is **buoyant relative to the mantle**    
- It **resists permanent subduction** and tends to "jam" or "pop back up"
    

So when felsic crust **does** get subducted:

- It is often part of **a complex terrane collision**    
- It may be **scraped off** and accreted to the overriding plate    
- Or it may be **partially melted**, with lighter components rising back as **felsic magma**, contributing to **continental volcanism**
    
### 🔥 Subduction-Driven Volcanism:

The **melt** from subducted slabs (mostly mafic oceanic crust + water-rich sediments) rises and:

- Interacts with the overlying **continental lithosphere**    
- Mixes with or **melts felsic components**    
- Produces **andesitic to rhyolitic magma** (more viscous and explosive than basalt)
    

This is why volcanic arcs (e.g., the Andes, Cascades, Japan) are:
- Continental in character    
- Erupting **felsic lavas**, not oceanic basalt
### 🧭 W101 Summary Point:

> 🔍 **Continental crust is rarely destroyed.**  
> When it’s pulled into a subduction zone:

- It tends to **resurface via volcanism**,   
- Or **get welded onto other landmasses**,    
- Or **form mountains** via crustal thickening and uplift.
    
Over billions of years, this is how Earth built up its continents.

### 🧓 Why Some Rocks Are 3.7 Billion Years Old

Those ancient rocks in **Scotland**, **Greenland**, **Australia**, and **Canada** are part of what we call **cratons** — old, stable cores of continental lithosphere that have:
- **Survived** every tectonic rearrangement    
- **Resisted** subduction due to buoyancy    
- **Avoided** recycling into the mantle    
- Often remained **above sea level** or **only shallowly 
    

These regions include formations like:
- **The Isua Greenstone Belt** in Greenland    
- **The Jack Hills zircon deposits** in Australia    
- **The Lewisian complex** in Scotland
    

They are made of **felsic or ultra-felsic rocks**, like granite and gneiss, and represent:

> The surviving scaffolding of Earth’s first continents.

### 🧭 :

- **Oceanic crust is temporary** — it's made, spread, and subducted like conveyor belt parts.    
- **Continental crust is archival** — it builds up over time, preserves history, and keeps records.
    
So a 3.7-billion-year-old rock is a **literal relic** of the early Earth, untouched by recycling, uplifted by tectonics, and never drowned or subducted deep enough to erase its story.

> 🔍 If your world has **ancient exposed felsic terranes**, it implies: 
> - Very old crust (from early tectonic activity)     
> - Long-term tectonic **stability**  
> - Minimal subduction or high rates of crustal buoyancy     
> - Possibly **low sea level** or **uplifted interiors**
