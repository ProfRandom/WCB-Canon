# Sidebar Module — Mind the Gap – The Shortcomings of the Traditional Spectral Scale

The classical stellar spectral sequence — O, B, A, F, G, K, M — originated as a cataloging system based on observed absorption lines in starlight. It was never designed to be linear, complete, or even particularly rational. And it shows.

> 🔍 _Spectral types weren’t designed — they accreted._

- Early classifiers like **Annie Jump Cannon** grouped stars by hydrogen line strength.
    
- Later work (e.g., by Morgan, Keenan, and Payne-Gaposchkin) retrofitted those types to surface temperature.
    
- The result? **Inconsistent temperature spans**, irregular gaps between classes, and no underlying mathematical symmetry.
    

### 🌡️ Consider the G–F Discontinuity:

- **F9 → G0**: Drop of only ~150 K
    
- **F0 → F9**: Nearly 1350 K
    
- Linear? Not even close.

## 🧭 Why WBN Fixes This

Worldbuilder’s Notebook (WBN) adopts a **linearized spectral system**:

- Each spectral class is assigned a clean temperature range
    
- Subclasses divide that range evenly
    
- The system becomes **interpolatable**, **predictable**, and **symbolically clear**
    

This makes it easier to:

- Calculate stellar parameters from temperature
    
- Relate stars to their orbits and Thermozones
    
- Avoid the awkwardness of stars that fall “between classes”
    

> ⚖️ _The WBN scale isn’t astrophysically perfect — but it’s symbolically powerful, and consistently usable._

## 📌 Bottom Line

If your fiction or modeling needs the exact, messy mess of real-world classification? Use real-world data.  
But if you need a system that supports symbolic structure, habitability logic, and easy computation?
