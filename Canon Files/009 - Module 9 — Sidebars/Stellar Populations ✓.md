# Stellar Populations
Another way stars are sometimes classed is by stellar population; somewhat confusingly, these are also designated by Roman numerals, but in this case the number indicates the ***metallicity*** of the star.

> **Keppy**: Metallicity?!?!

Yep; for astronomers, any element that's not hydrogen or helium is a "metal" — apparently astronomers and chemists don't talk to each other.

| Population     | Description      |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Population I   | High Metallicity |
| Population II  | Low Metallicity  |
| Population III | Zero Metallicity |
The stellar population number can be taken as a _rough_ estimate of a star's age, but here is where the system is confusing, because the population number are "backward".  Population I stars are high metallicity stars like the Sun, and are the most recent "generation" of stars.  Population III stars (if any actually still exist) are almost totally lacking in metals, and are the first stars to have formed in the early universe when hydrogen and helium were the only raw material on offer.

An alternative way of thinking about stellar populations might be as "generations", numbered in reverse sequence to populations:

| Generation     | Population     | Description      |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Generation III | Population I   | High Metallicity |
| Generation II  | Population II  | Low Metallicity  |
| Generation 1   | Population III | Zero Metallicity |
## Stars: The Next Generation

>Keppy: So, will there be a Generation IV?

Probably not — and here's why: 
- While there is certainly still star-forming going on in the universe (the Orion Nebula, for instance), the stars forming there are still Population I/Generation III stars.
- The gasses and heavier elements that are going into their composition aren't changing in relative proportions over time.
- Supper massive stars _are_ still producing heavy elements, and novae and supernovae are still distributing those elements into the cosmos, the overall amounts of such heavy elements is not increasing, and heavy elements are not being produced at a faster rate than in the past.

Newly formed stars, then don't have basic compositions in any fundamental way different from the previous generation.

>In fact, if the "heat death" model of the universe is correct, star formation will _decrease_ with time, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes will eventually replace self-luminous fusors, and everything will settle into a "steady state" that will persist for eternity.
