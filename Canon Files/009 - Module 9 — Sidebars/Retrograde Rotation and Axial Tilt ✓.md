> **Keppy**: Wait… isn’t retrograde motion an orbital thing?  

Not always. planemos can also **rotate** in a retrograde sense — spinning "backwards" compared to their orbital direction.  And remember what is "up" in a star system is _purely a matter of convention_; ignoring direction of orbital motion, we could just as easily say that Venus is the only prograde planemo in the Solar System.

#### 🧭 How to Know:

- Axial tilt (ε) is the angle between the planemo’s spin axis and the perpendicular to its orbital plane.
    
- If **ε ∈ ⟨0° ∧ 90°⟩**, the rotation is **prograde** — the planemo spins the same direction as it orbits.
    
- If **ε ∈ ⟨90° ∧ 180°⟩**, the rotation is **retrograde** — the planemo spins the _opposite_ direction from its orbit.

> What we call “prograde” or “retrograde” is just a matter of **convention**.
> 
> We define “up” in the Solar System based on Earth’s north pole and orbital direction.  
> But that's completely arbitrary.  
> If we flipped the system and redefined "north" as "south," **Venus would become the _only_ prograde planemo**, and all the others would be retrograde.

#### 🪐 Example: Venus

- Axial tilt: **177.4°**
    
- Spins incredibly slowly and **retrograde**
    
- A full Venus day (sidereal) is ~243 Earth days
    
- But because of its retrograde spin, a **solar day** (sunrise to sunrise) lasts ~117 Earth days — and the Sun rises in the **west**!

#### 🌀 Why This Matters

- ε > 90° radically changes **day/night direction**, **sun path across the sky**, and even **cultural orientation** ("sun rises in the west").
    
- High obliquity + retrograde spin = **wildly different** seasonal or diurnal patterns.
    
- For worldbuilders: this is a prime lever to make a world _feel_ subtly alien while remaining physically plausible.

#### 🧭 **How It Works**

- A planemo’s **axial tilt (ε)** is defined as the angle between its rotational axis and the perpendicular to its orbital plane.
    
- **ε ∈ ⟨0° ∧ 90°⟩** → **prograde rotation**  
    (spin direction aligns with orbital motion)
    
- **ε ∈ ⟨90° ∧ 180°⟩** → **retrograde rotation**  
    (spin direction opposes orbital motion)
    

So:

- **Earth**: ε ≈ 23.44° → prograde
    
- **Venus**: ε ≈ **177.4°** → retrograde
    
    - It’s tipped almost completely upside down — a rotation that is _both slow_ and _backwards_
        
- **Uranus**: ε ≈ **97.8°** → technically retrograde
    
    - Lies nearly on its side; its axial pole dips below the orbital plane

#### 📌 **Retrograde Rotation at a Glance**

|**Axial Tilt (ε)**|**Rotation Type**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|0°|Perfectly prograde|Theoretical ideal|
|23.4°|Prograde|Earth|
|90°|Sideways / ambiguous|Theoretical (unstable)|
|97.8°|Retrograde|Uranus|
|177.4°|Retrograde|Venus|
|180°|Perfectly retrograde|Theoretical limit|

#### 🪐 **Why It Matters**

- ε > 90° affects **day-night patterns**, **sunrise/sunset direction**, and even **seasonal progression**.
    
- Can produce a “**solar reversal**” — the Sun appears to rise in the west and set in the east.
    
- Combined with slow rotation, it may completely upend expectations about **day length**, **thermal cycling**, and **climatic intuition**.
