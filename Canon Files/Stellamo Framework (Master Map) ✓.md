# ⭐ Stellamo Framework (Master Map)
All **Stellamos** (stellar monobodies) share a **common trunk** — then branch into two complementary classification systems.

---
## 🌳 Trunk (Shared Levels)
- **Frame** → Monobody    
- **Group** → Stellamo   

---
## 🌈 Spectral Branch (Temperature / Spectrum)
Focus: **What the star _is_, by surface temperature and spectral features**
- **Spectral Class** → Broad categories (O, B, A, F, G, K, M)    
- **Spectral Subclass** → Decimal divisions within a class (e.g. G2, M5)    
- **Spectral Type** → Spectral Class + Luminosity Class (e.g. G2V, K3III)    

---
## 💡 Luminosity Branch (Structure / Evolutionary Stage)
Focus: **What the star _does_, by size, brightness, and life-cycle**
- **Luminosity Class** → Morphological grouping by stellar radius & brightness    
    - 0 = Hypergiant        
    - Ia/Iab/Ib = Supergiant        
    - II = Bright giant        
    - III = Giant        
    - IV = Subgiant        
    - V = Main sequence (dwarf)        
    - VI = Subdwarf        
    - VII = White dwarf
        
- **Evolutionary Phase** (optional refinement inside each class)    
    - Protostar → Main sequence → Giant → White dwarf → Remnant (NS/BH)

## 🔄 Intersections

- **Spectral Type** = Intersection of **Spectral Class/Subclass** with **Luminosity Class**    
    - Example: the Sun = **G2V** (Spectral Class G, subclass 2, Luminosity Class V).        
    - Proxima Centauri = **M5.5V**.        
    - Rigel = **B8Ia**.        

---
## 🧭 Principle
- **Spectral Branch** = _surface physics_ (temperature, color, composition).    
- **Luminosity Branch** = _structural physics_ (radius, brightness, lifecycle stage).    
- Both are **lateral axes**: their **intersection defines the star’s Spectral Type.**    

---

✅ Example:
- Sun = G (Class) → G2 (Subclass) → Luminosity V → **G2V Spectral Type**.    
- Betelgeuse = M (Class) → M2 (Subclass) → Luminosity Ia → **M2Ia Spectral Type**.
