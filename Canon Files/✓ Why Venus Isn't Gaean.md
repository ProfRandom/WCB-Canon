## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Demonstrates why Venus, despite meeting **Geotic Envelope** physical criteria, fails **Gaean classification**.  
- Venus as **Geotic**:  
  - Mass (0.815 ⨁), radius (0.949 ⨁), density (0.95 ⨁), gravity (0.90 ⨁), escape velocity (0.93 ⨁).  
  - All values fall within Geotic bounds, making Venus structurally Earthlike.  
- Venus not **Gaean**:  
  - Atmosphere: 92 atm CO₂ with sulfuric acid aerosols.  
  - Surface temperature: ~735 K (462 °C), runaway greenhouse effect.  
  - Magnetosphere: lacks intrinsic magnetic field.  
  - Hydrosphere: no stable surface water.  
- Concludes that physical plausibility (Geotic) must be separated from habitability (Gaean).  
- Illustrates WCB taxonomy: **not all Geotics are Gaeans**.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Geotic [sci].**  
- **Gaean [sci].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Both Geotic and Gaean are already canonical.  
- This file provides a case study reinforcing the distinction.  
- **Status:** [EXPANDED] — applies existing canon to Venus as a worked example.

# Why Venus Isn’t Gaean

Although Venus falls squarely within the **Geotic Envelope** (its mass, radius, density, surface gravity, and escape velocity are all near-Terran), it fails the stricter criteria for **Gaean classification**.  

The extreme atmospheric composition, runaway greenhouse effect, lack of a protective magnetosphere, and absence of stable hydrospheric cycles render it inhospitable to unmodified humans and hostile to Terran-style biospheres.

## Venus as Geotic

By the numbers, Venus is a **Geotic planemo**:  

- **Mass (m):** 0.815 ⨁  
- **Radius (r):** 0.949 ⨁  
- **Density (ρ):** 0.95 ⨁  
- **Surface Gravity (g):** 0.90 ⨁  
- **Escape Velocity (vₑ):** 0.93 ⨁  

These all fall neatly within the **Geotic Envelope** (0.30–3.35 m, 0.85–1.25 ρ, 0.60–1.65 g, 0.60–1.50 r, 0.65–1.50 vₑ).  
By physical structure alone, Venus is almost Earth’s twin.

## Why Venus Fails Gaean Classification

Despite its Geotic parameters, Venus cannot be called **Gaean**:  

- **Atmosphere:** 92 atm of CO₂, with sulfuric acid aerosols.  
- **Surface Temperature:** ~735 K (462 °C), caused by a runaway greenhouse effect.  
- **Magnetosphere:** Lacks a protective intrinsic magnetic field, leaving the atmosphere vulnerable to solar stripping.  
- **Hydrosphere:** No stable water; surface is desiccated.  

These factors eliminate the possibility of unaided human survival and preclude a Terran-like biosphere.

## Conclusion

Venus is **Geotic** in terms of its physical parameters, but it is not **Gaean** in terms of habitability.  
This distinction illustrates why the WCB taxonomy separates **Geotic envelopes** (physical plausibility) from **Gaean classification** (true Terran habitability).
