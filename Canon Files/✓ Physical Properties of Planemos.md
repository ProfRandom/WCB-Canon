## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **five fundamental physical properties** of planemos:  
  - **Mass (m):** total matter present (distinct from weight).  
  - **Density (ρ):** matter per unit volume, affected by composition and gravitational compression.  
  - **Radius (r):** center-to-surface distance, treated as emergent from mass and density.  
  - **Surface Gravity (g):** acceleration at the surface, dependent on mass and radius.  
  - **Escape Velocity (v):** minimum speed to overcome gravity, also dependent on mass and radius.  
- Explains **interdependence**: radius emergent from mass and density, density altered by gravitational compression, gravity and escape velocity derived from the mass–radius relationship.  
- Notes **inverse-square law** as foundation for gravitational effects.  
- Invokes **sed ego dico** as an editorial simplification, prioritizing usability over perfect physical rigor.  
- Provides real-world analogies (e.g., water vs. iron density) to clarify concepts.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **m, ρ, r, g, v** — planemo equations of state variables.  
- **Gravitational Compression [neo].**  
- **Inverse-square law [sci].**  
- **Sed ego dico [meta].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- All five properties are already defined in canon and equations of state.  
- **Gravitational Compression [neo]** reinforced.  
- **Inverse-square law [sci]** already established in stellar/orbital contexts.  
- **Sed ego dico [meta]** consistent with existing editorial conventions.  
- **Status:** [EXPANDED] — reinforces existing canon with emphasis on emergent and interdependent properties.

## Parameter Ranges by Spectral Class

**Abstract:**  
This file presents a tabulated set of **stellar parameters by spectral class (O–M)**, with high, mean, and low values given for each. Parameters included are:  

- **Effective temperature (K)**  
- **Thermal Interval Constant (þ)** — the step size in Kelvin that defines subclass increments  
- **Temperature (T⊙)** relative to the Sun  
- **Radius (R⊙)** relative to the Sun  
- **Luminosity (L⊙)** relative to the Sun  
- **Mass (M⊙)** relative to the Sun  
- **Frequency (Q⊙)** relative to the Sun  

The table serves as a **ready reference for stellar design** in worldbuilding, allowing thesiasts to quickly identify plausible ranges of physical values across the standard stellar sequence. It systematizes how subclass divisions are calculated (using the TIC, þ) and provides both absolute and relative values for major stellar quantities.  

**Canon Links:**  
- Connects to **Spectral Classes, Types, and Parameters** (M002 Stars series).  
- Uses the **Thermal Interval Constant (þ) [neo]** as defined elsewhere in WCB.  
- Values support calculations in **Habitable Zones**, **Fundamental Orbits**, and related stellar-orbital frameworks.  

**Lexical Tags:**  
- **[sci]** Spectral Classes, Tempera

## Physical Properties of Planemos

There are five properties of planemos that can be thought of as _physical properties_ — insofar as they describe the planemo physically or a property of the planemo that emerges from the other physical properties.  These are:

1. ***Mass*** (m):  The total amount of matter present. (_Mass and weight are not the same — weight depends on gravity; mass does not_.)
2. ***Density*** (ρ):  The average amount of matter per unit volume — essentially, how tightly packed the planemo’s materials are. This depends on both composition (e.g. rock, ice, metal) and, for larger bodies, gravitational self-compression.
3. ***Radius*** (r):  The distance from the planemo’s center to its surface.  Technically, this is derived from the planemo’s mass and average density — but more on this in a moment.
4. ***Surface Gravity*** (g):  The strength of gravitational acceleration at the planemo’s surface — how strongly it attracts objects located one radius away from its center.
5. ***Escape Velocity*** (v): The minimum speed needed to completely escape the planemo’s gravity when starting from the surface — how much velocity is required to leave the planemo entirely.

These are all intricately interrelated in ways that are much more complicated than we need to account for here.  For instance, while **radius** _is_ derived from **mass** and **density**, it also matters how strongly the mass of the planemo is gravitationally acting on itself.  This causes ***gravitational compression***, which means that the matter is forced into a denser configuration than it would otherwise exhibit _if it were not under such intense gravitational pull_.  So, it is also true that **density** in some sense is derived from **mass** and **radius**.

Surface gravity and escape velocity are also very dependent on both mass and radius.  The farther a point on the surface of the planemo is from the planemo's center, the less gravitational attraction from the planemo it experiences, decreasing according to the ***inverse-square law*** (more on this later).  And the weaker the surface gravity, the less energy it takes to overcome it, so the lower the escape velocity.

For our purposes, it is reasonable to simplify things and say:

> Radius is an _emergent property_ of the interaction of mass and density.

... and not be too overly concerned about the subtleties.

>  **Keppy**: _Sed ego dico_, right?

Yes; this is our first official invocation of _sed ego dico_, "because I say".  No, it's not _entirely physically accurate_, but it's good enough for what we need to accomplish.

Mass and density are also dependent upon what materials the planemo is made of: most planemos are composed of several materials (rock, ice, liquid water, etc.).  Rock, itself, can composed of any number of more basic elements and compounds.

And all of these materials have their own inherent densities.  Water, for instance, has a density of about 1.0 g/cm³ (and is, in fact the _standard_ for material density in the metric system we're using.)   Iron, on the other hand, has a density of about 7.7 g/cm³  — almost eight times that of water.  So 1 kilogram of water takes up more volume than one kilogram of iron.

> There is an old riddle, which was a favorite of my maternal grandfather: "Which is heavier — a pound of iron or a pound of feathers?"  The trick to the question, of course, is that both _weigh_ a pound, but because feathers are less dense than iron, that pound (in its natural state) takes up far more volume than does the iron.
