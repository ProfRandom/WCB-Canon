# Etymology of "moon"
Most dictionaries are somewhat specific in defining the word “moon”: something along the lines of “a moon is a natural satellite of a planet”. However, modern exploration has shown this definition to be limiting: even asteroids have "moons" (Hebe 6 and $415$ others are known as of this writing). So, for our purposes, we need to be a bit more general.  WCB defines "moon" as  “a natural satellite of a monon more than 100 or more times more massive than itself.”

## "The" Moon
In English, the generic noun turned into a proper noun, “the Moon”, as a name for Earth’s only natural satellite. Other English names for the Moon, less commonly seen or used, include Luna, Selene, and Cynthia (the first is Latin, the others Greek). The most common adjectival form used to refer to the Moon is "lunar", though you might also sometimes see “selenic" and “cynthion" (with a hard ‘c’).

As a proper noun, the name “Moon” comes from Old English *mōna*, stemming from Proto-Germanic \**mēnōn*, itself from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) \**mēnsis*, which meant "month" (and still exists in English as “menses”), ultimately derived from PIE \**mēnōt* "to measure", because the Moon's phases were used to measure that unit of time.

In WCB, we will most often refer to Earth's Moon by the Roman name Luna, along with its related terms "lunar", "lunation", — 

> **Keppy:** And "lunacy"!

> **Hippy:** You'd know, Keplarius; you'd know.

For convenience, we'll often just use "moon" generically and more specific terms when distinction is called-for.
## Types
### Regular Moons
Regular moons:
- Orbit fairly closely to their primaron
- Tend to have *prograde* orbits (their orbital motion is the same as the rotational direction of their primaron)
- Have little-to-no orbital inclination
- Enjoy small orbital eccentricities
- Are usually _primogenic_ (they formed at the same time as their primeron)

There are 57 known _regular_ satellites in the Solar system:

| Planet  | Satellites |                        |
| ------- | ---------: | ---------------------- |
| Earth   |          1 |                        |
| Jupiter |          8 |                        |
| Saturn  |         23 | (that have been named) |
| Uranus  |         18 | (known so far)         |
| Neptune |          7 |                        |

### Irregular Moons
Irregular moons:
- Follow more distant orbits
- Sometimes orbit *retrograde* (their orbital motion is opposite that of the rotational direction of their primaron)
- Often have high orbital inclination
- Accompanied by high orbital eccentricities
- Are almost exclusively _syllipsic_ (they were captured by their primeron's gravity after forming elsewhere)

As of this writing, there are considered to be 125 irregular moons in orbit around the giant planets of the Solar system and two orbiting Mars.

## Classes
### Major Moons
Major moons are those which have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium (they are mostly spherical) due to their own gravity.  Luna is a major moon, as are the Galilean moons of Jupiter, Saturn's Titan, Neptune's Triton — in total 18:

| Moon      | Planet  | Moon Radius (km) |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------: |
| Ganymede  | Jupiter |             2634 |
| Titan     | Saturn  |             2576 |
| Callisto  | Jupiter |             2408 |
| Io        | Jupiter |             1818 |
| Luna      | Earth   |           1738.1 |
| Europa    | Jupiter |             1561 |
| Triton    | Neptune |             1353 |
| Titania   | Uranus  |            788.4 |
| Rhea      | Saturn  |            763.5 |
| Oberon    | Uranus  |            761.4 |
| Iapetus   | Saturn  |            734.3 |
| Umbriel   | Uranus  |            584.7 |
| Ariel     | Uranus  |            578.9 |
| Dione     | Saturn  |              561 |
| Tethys    | Saturn  |              531 |
| Enceladus | Saturn  |            252.1 |
| Miranda   | Uranus  |            235.8 |
| Mimas     | Saturn  |            198.2 |

### Minor Moons
Minor moons lack enough mass to have achieved fully spherical shape; two of the better-known minor moons are Phobos and Deimos, the companions of Mars.  How many minor moons there are in the Solar system is entirely a matter of who you ask.

## Combining Classes and Types
In general, major moons are regular moons, and in general minor moons are irregular moons.  As with everything, there are exceptions: Triton, for instance, _appears_ to have been a dwarf planemon that passed within Neptune's Hill sphere radius at a slow enough angular momentum to have been captured.  Triton's orbit is very nearly circular and it orbits close to Neptune (which are characteristics of a regular moon), but it's orbit is retrograde and highly inclined (which are characteristics of an irregular moon).  It's massive enough to be spherical, which makes it a major moon, so, all-in-all, we'd call it a major-irregular moon.

Examples of minor-irregular moons abound in the Solar system, but not all of them submit to easy categorization.  Phobos and Deimos, for instance are minor-irreglar moons, _despite_ the fact that they orbit close to Mars in prograde orbits with less than $2^\circ$ inclinations — which are characteristics of regular moons.

> Interestingly Phobos orbits Mars in less time ($7^h\; 39^m\; 12^s$) than it takes mars to rotate on its axis ($24^h\; 37^m\; 22^s$).  So, as seen from the surface of Mars, Phobos rises in the _west_ and sets in the _east_ about twice per Martian day (every $11^h\;6^m$).
