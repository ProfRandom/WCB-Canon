## Orbital Eccentricity and Seasonal Effects
For a planet with semimajor axis *a* and eccentricity *e*:
- **Perihelion distance**:  
$$
r_p = a (1 - e)
$$
- **Aphelion distance**:
$$
r_a = a (1 + e)
$$

### Distance Difference
The fractional difference in distance between perihelion and aphelion is:

$$
\dot{D} = \frac{1+e}{1-e} - 1 = \frac{2e}{1-e}
$$

- Earth ($e = 0.0167$):  
  $\dot{D} \approx 0.034$ → **3.4% closer at perihelion**  
- Rosetta ($e = 0.05$):  
  $\dot{D} \approx 0.105$ → **10.5% closer at perihelion**

### Insolation (Flux) Difference
Since $flux ∝ 1/r^2$, the perihelion/aphelion flux ratio is:

$$
\frac{F_p}{F_a} = \left(\frac{1+e}{1-e}\right)^2
$$
$$
ß = \frac{1+e}{1-e} - 1 \quad;\quad e = \frac{ß}{ß + 2}
$$
- Earth ($e = 0.0167$):  
  $\dfrac{F_p}{F_a} \approx 1.068$ → **6.8% stronger insolation at perihelion**  
- Rosetta ($e = 0.05$):  
  $\dfrac{F_p}{F_a} \approx 1.23$ → **23% stronger insolation at perihelion**

### WCB Note
- **Distance form** → good for intuitive “how much closer/farther” language.  
- **Flux form** → good for climatic impact (“how much hotter/colder”).  
- Both are simple, memorable shortcuts for estimating seasonal asymmetry.
