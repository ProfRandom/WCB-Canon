## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Outlines the **dual-branch classification system** for planemos (planetary monobodies).  
- **Conformation branch** (structural/physical): based on composition and physical form.  
  - Orders: Lithic, Astatic, Aetheric, Ulsic.  
  - Forms: Petriform, Carboform, Pagoform, Fluxiform, Transiform, Pneumoform, Haliform, Neutraform, Quarkform, etc.  
- **Ontosomic branch** (life-relevance): based on relation to biospheric potential.  
  - Classes: Geotic, Gaean, Rheatic, Xenotic.  
  - Types: Subdivisions (e.g., Marginal Geotic, Dense Hot Rheatic).  
  - States (Climostates): Global climate regimes (Cryostate, Hydrostate, Pyrostate, Pluristate, etc.).  
  - Conditions: Atmospheric/seasonal descriptors (Tempestal, Zephyral, Serenal, etc.).  
- Both branches are independent but complementary lenses for describing the same planemo.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Planemo** ‚Äî planetary monobody, trunk-level category.  
- **Conformation** ‚Äî physical/chemical classification.  
- **Ontosomy** ‚Äî life-relevance classification.  
- **Orders/Forms** ‚Äî structural breakdown of planemo types.  
- **Classes/Types/States/Conditions** ‚Äî biospheric breakdown of livability.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Provides the **master map** for all other planemo-related classifications.  
- Ensures that **physical identity** (Conformation) and **biospheric identity** (Ontosomic) can coexist without collision.  
- Anchors subordinate classifications (e.g., Gaean, Rheatic, Hydrostate subtypes).

# üåç Planemo Framework (Master Map)

All **Planemos** (planetary monobodies) share a **common trunk** ‚Äî then branch into two complementary classification systems.

---
## üå≥ Trunk (Shared Levels)

- **Frame** ‚Üí Monobody    
- **Group** ‚Üí Planemo   

---
## ü™® Conformation Branch (Structural / Physical)
Focus: **What the planemo is made of**
- **Order** ‚Üí Composition families    
    - Lithic (rock/metal)        
    - Astatic (mixed/volatile)        
    - Aetheric (gaseous)        
    - Ulsic (exotic/degenerate)
        
- **Form** ‚Üí Subdivisions of each order    
    - Lithic ‚Üí Petriform, Carboform        
    - Astatic ‚Üí Pagoform, Fluxiform        
    - Aetheric ‚Üí Transiform, Pneumoform, Haliform        
    - Ulsic ‚Üí Neutraform, Quarkform, etc.

## üå± Ontosomic Branch (Life-Relevance / Biospheric)
Focus: **How the planemo relates to life (esp. Earthlike envelopes)**
- **Class** ‚Üí Broad livability envelopes    
    - Geotic (Earth-normal range)        
    - Gaean (Earth-twin slice of Geotic)        
    - Rheatic (super-Earths with biospheric richness)        
    - Xenotic (exotic chemistries / non-carbonic)
        
- **Type** ‚Üí Subdivisions of classes    
    - Marginal Geotic, Dense Hot Rheatic, etc.

- **State (Climostates)** ‚Üí Global climatic conditions    
    - Cryostate (frozen)        
    - Hydrostate (temperate hydrosphere)        
    - Pyrostate (runaway greenhouse)        
    - Pluristate (diverse climates)        
    - etc.
        
- **Condition** ‚Üí Finer descriptors of atmospheric/seasonal character    
    - Tempestal (storm-dominated)        
    - Zephyral (mild winds, gentle climate)        
    - Serenal (stable, calm, serene environment)

## üß≠ Principle
- **Conformation** = _physical chemistry_ of the body.    
- **Ontosomy** = _life-relevance_ of the body.    
- Both are **valid, independent lenses** for describing the same planemo.
    
- Example:    
    - Earth = Lithic (Order) ‚Üí Petriform (Form)        
    - Earth = Geotic (Class) ‚Üí Gaean (Type) ‚Üí Pluristate (State) ‚Üí Serenal (Condition)
