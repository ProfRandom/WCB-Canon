**Major Topics:**  
- Definition of the **SANC Principle** (*Science-Adjacent, No Calculus*).  
- Scope of mathematical tools for WCB: algebra, geometry, trigonometry.  
- Exclusion of higher-level tools: calculus, tensors, advanced astrophysics.  
- Guiding philosophy: “Rigor without rigidity.”  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- SANC = Science-Adjacent, No Calculus.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Canon as of Glossary v1.212.

# 🔑 The SANC Principle

**SANC = Science-Adjacent, No Calculus.**

- ✅ We use **algebra, geometry, and trigonometry** — the practical tools any builder can wield.  
- 🚫 We skip **calculus, tensors, and full astrophysics** — that’s outside our scope.  
- 🎯 Goal: **Rigor without rigidity.** Enough math to make worlds believable, never so much that it strangles imagination.  

*Think of SANC as your worldmaking passport: it gets you everywhere you need to go,  
but it won’t weigh you down with equations better left to astrophysicists.*
