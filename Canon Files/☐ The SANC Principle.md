# ðŸ”‘ The SANC Principle

**SANC = Science-Adjacent, No Calculus.**

- âœ… We use **algebra, geometry, and trigonometry** â€” the practical tools any builder can wield.  
- ðŸš« We skip **calculus, tensors, and full astrophysics** â€” thatâ€™s outside our scope.  
- ðŸŽ¯ Goal: **Rigor without rigidity.** Enough math to make worlds believable, never so much that it strangles imagination.  

*Think of SANC as your worldmaking passport: it gets you everywhere you need to go,  
but it wonâ€™t weigh you down with equations better left to astrophysicists.*
