## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines the **Anthropic Norm**: the universe and its functioning as presently perceived, absent extreme or rare conditions.  
- Closely tied to the **Mediocritic Principle of State**:  
  - The majority of matter and energy in the current epoch exists within a **statistically dominant modal band** of states.  
  - Extreme states (e.g., black holes, neutronium, degenerate matter) may be numerous but are **exceptions**, not norm-defining.  
- Key insights for worldbuilding:  
  1. **Rarity ≠ Normativity**: unusual states, even if interesting, should not define the baseline.  
  2. **Normativity = Modal, not Mean**: the “normal” universe is not the statistical average, but the modal cluster where most matter/energy exists most of the time.  
- Examples:  
  - The universe is filled with stars, but is not “mostly plasma” under current conditions.  
  - Neutron stars exist, but the cosmos is not composed of neutronium.  
  - Rocky planemos form from volatiles, but the universe remains overwhelmingly hydrogen and helium gas.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Anthropic Norm [NEW].**  
- **Mediocritic Principle of State [NEW].**  
- **Modal Cluster [sci].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- No prior mention of these terms in canon; both are newly introduced philosophical-structural concepts.  
- Complements existing WCB philosophical principles (e.g., Protagorean Principle).  
- **Status:** [NEW] — establishes a normative philosophical baseline for worldbuilding.

# The Anthropic Norm

The universe and its functioning as we currently perceive it, absent any extreme conditions.

### The Anthropic Norm & the Mediocritic Principle of State

> The vast majority of matter and energy in the universe exists within a narrow, statistically dominant band of physical states —  from which it deviates only rarely and locally, within the current cosmological epoch.

This leads to two foundational insights for thesiastic modeling:
1. **Rarity is not normativity.**  
    Extreme states — from black holes to degenerate matter — may be _numerous_, but they are not **norm-defining**. They are **local exceptions** to a global pattern.    
2. **Normativity is modal, not mean.**  
    The Anthropic Norm does not lie at the statistical _average_, but at the **modal cluster**:  
    the zone in which **most matter and energy exist most of the time** under current universal conditions.
Thus:
- The universe is filled with stars, but is mostly _not_ plasma.  
    _(It was **at one time** — but that was a different epoch.)_    
- Neutron stars are real, but the universe is _not_ mostly neutronium.    
- Volatiles can form rocky planemos — but the cosmos is _overwhelmingly_ hydrogen and helium in gaseous form.
