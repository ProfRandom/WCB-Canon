## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **Rheatic planemos** as **parahabitable super-Earths**, favorable to robust biospheres but often inhospitable to unmodified humans.  
- Parameter corridors:  
  - Mass (m): 1.00–3.00 ⨁  
  - Density (ρ): 0.85–1.25 ⨁  
  - Surface Gravity (g): 0.85–1.70 ⨁  
  - Radius (r): 0.90–1.50 ⨁  
  - Escape Velocity (vₑ): 0.95–1.50 ⨁  
- **Overlap with Gaeans:** ≈13.9% of Rheatics fall within Gaean gravity bounds (0.9–1.1 ⨁), making them unusually favorable worlds with both Earthlike conditions and enhanced biospheric potential.  
- **Core Feature:** Larger, denser terrestrial bodies → broader climatic bands, longer tectonic–volcanic cycling, stronger magnetospheres, and more biospheric resilience (“superhabitable” qualities).  
- **Implications for settlement:** Human colonization possible but requires adaptation: medical mitigation for high gravity, structural reinforcement, climate control.  
- **Distinction:**  
  - All Rheatics are Geotics, but skew toward higher mass/density.  
  - Only a small subset are Gaean.  
  - Serves as the WCB counterpart to **“superhabitable” exoplanets** in the scientific literature.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Rheatic** — Parahabitable terrestrial super-Earth, biosphere-rich but human-straining.  
- **m, ρ, g, r, vₑ** — Fundamental planemo parameters (Earth-relative).  
- **Superhabitable Zone** — WCB framing of biosphere-enhancing corridors.  
- **Overlap Fraction:** ≈13.9% of Rheatics are also Gaean.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Consolidates external “superhabitable” terminology under the WCB neolex **Rheatic**.  
- Provides numeric corridors to distinguish Rheatics from Geotics and Gaeans.  
- Complements **Justifying Parahabitable Parameter Limits** by filling in the higher-mass end of the spectrum.

> _Rheatics_ are **parahabitable** planemos — terrestrial super-Earths with conditions **favorable to rich biospheres** but likely **inhospitable to unmodified humans**. They may possess higher surface gravity, thicker atmospheres, and more energetic climates, often demanding mechanical, biological, or infrastructural adaptations for long-term Earthling presence. Nonetheless, they are considered highly conducive to complex, robust life — just not necessarily Earthlike.

**Overlap with Gaeans**:
- A **small subset** of Rheatics — **≈13.9%** — fall within the Gaean gravity range (0.9 ≤ g ≤ 1.1⨁).    
- These rare worlds are **massive and dense** enough to support Earth-normal surface conditions **while offering enhanced biospheric potential** — possibly the best of both worlds.
**Core Feature**:
- The **“superhabitable” zone**: larger size means broader climatic bands, more plate tectonics, greater magnetic shielding, and longer tectonic–volcanic cycling — all of which may favor biospheric richness and diversity.    
- **Human settlement** is plausible but typically **requires support**: enhanced structural design, medical mitigation of gravity effects, and climate regulation systems.
**Distinction from Geotics**:
- All Rheatics meet **Geotic** compositional constraints, but their **mass and gravity trends upward**.    
- **Not all Geotics** are Rheatic: Rheatics are a **subset of high-mass, dense, habitable** planemos.    
- Conversely, **not all Rheatics are Gaean** — only a small slice of them match that precise Earthlike window.
