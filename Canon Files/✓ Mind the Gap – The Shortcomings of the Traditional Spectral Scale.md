## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Critiques the **traditional stellar spectral sequence** (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) as inconsistent, non-linear, and historically accreted rather than systematically designed.  
- Highlights specific discontinuities (e.g., **F9 → G0 only ~150 K**, while **F0 → F9 spans ~1350 K**) to show irregular subclass gaps.  
- Explains how the **Worldmaking framework (WBN)** resolves these issues by adopting a **linearized spectral system**:  
  - Each class is assigned a clean, evenly divided temperature range.  
  - Subclasses interpolate predictably across the scale.  
  - Enables symbolic clarity, ease of computation, and consistency with habitability modeling.  
- Distinguishes use cases:  
  - Use **traditional astrophysical data** when realism is desired.  
  - Use the **linearized WBN scale** for symbolic and modeling coherence.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Spectral classes:** O, B, A, F, G, K, M.  
- **Linearized spectral scale (WBN):** evenly spaced subclasses across temperature ranges.  
- **Thermozones:** orbital/temperature relationships tied to stellar classification.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Complements *M002 — Stars: 01 Spectral Classes* (which already introduces the linearized scale).  
- This note serves as a **sidebar critique and justification** for adopting the WBN linearized system.  
- No new glossary terms or symbols required; all terms already established in existing canon.

# Mind the Gap – The Shortcomings of the Traditional Spectral Scale

The classical stellar spectral sequence — O, B, A, F, G, K, M — originated as a cataloging system based on observed absorption lines in starlight. It was never designed to be linear, complete, or even particularly rational. And it shows.

> 🔍 _Spectral types weren’t designed — they accreted._

- Early classifiers like **Annie Jump Cannon** grouped stars by hydrogen line strength.
    
- Later work (e.g., by Morgan, Keenan, and Payne-Gaposchkin) retrofitted those types to surface temperature.
    
- The result? **Inconsistent temperature spans**, irregular gaps between classes, and no underlying mathematical symmetry.
    

### 🌡️ Consider the G–F Discontinuity:

- **F9 → G0**: Drop of only ~150 K
    
- **F0 → F9**: Nearly 1350 K
    
- Linear? Not even close.

## 🧭 Why WBN Fixes This

Worldbuilder’s Notebook (WBN) adopts a **linearized spectral system**:

- Each spectral class is assigned a clean temperature range
    
- Subclasses divide that range evenly
    
- The system becomes **interpolatable**, **predictable**, and **symbolically clear**
    

This makes it easier to:

- Calculate stellar parameters from temperature
    
- Relate stars to their orbits and Thermozones
    
- Avoid the awkwardness of stars that fall “between classes”
    

> ⚖️ _The WBN scale isn’t astrophysically perfect — but it’s symbolically powerful, and consistently usable._

## 📌 Bottom Line

If your fiction or modeling needs the exact, messy mess of real-world classification? Use real-world data.  
But if you need a system that supports symbolic structure, habitability logic, and easy computation?
