# Setting The Stage

## What Is A planemo?

Well, that depends on who you ask.  Officially, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), as of 2006[^IAU], a planemo is:

1. A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.
2. A dwarf planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite.
3. All other objects, except satellites, orbiting the sun shall be referred to collectively as small solar-system bodies.

This (in)famously demoted Pluto from full planet status.

Items **1c** and **2c** are the crux of the debate, specifically the criterion for having “cleared the neighborhood around its orbit”.  Some people find that specification too limiting, or even artfully chosen specifically to single Pluto out, since it resides in the inner regions of the Kuiper belt and has several near neighbors, whereas the full planets of the Solar system do not (not counting moons).

Tim DeBenedictis, in an article[^DeBene] at *Space.com*, argues for a much simpler planemo cutoff:  any body more than about 1,000 km in radius, orbiting its star on its own, will — no matter whether it’s made of rock, ice, or metal — inevitably take on a nearly spherical form under its own gravity.  

From this perspective, his definition trims away most of the IAU’s complexity:  
1. A **planet** is a celestial body that (a) orbits the Sun, and (b) has a surface radius exceeding 1,000 km (620 mi).  
2. All other objects in solar orbit, apart from satellites, are classed as **small solar-system bodies**.

I follow DeBenedictis’ suggestion (though to avoid some of the complications of existing definitions, I adopt  simplified terms):

1. A ***planemo***[^Basri] is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around a star or stars, and (b) has a maximum surface radius greater than 1,000 km (620 miles).
2. All other objects, except satellites, orbiting a star shall be referred to collectively as ***micromos*** (small star-system bodies; SSSB — moons, asteroids, comets, etc.).

...and I add the following proviso:

3. A ***world***  is a planemo that possesses a surface and/or atmospheric environment that is either ***habitable***  or ***parahabitable***.

### Habitable and Parahabitable

I define a *habitable* a planemo as one which is **immediately habitable** by humans; people from Earth could land there, walk out of their craft in their shirtsleeves, and start hiking around learning about the place, its wonders ... and its dangers.

In contrast a *parahabitable* planemo is one that is **provisionally habitable** by human beings through the use of technology like atmospheric domes, pressurized subterranean habitats, etc., which are:
 1. On or below the land or water surface; or,
 2. Suspended in the atmosphere by natural buoyancy or gravity-countering technology.  In other words, the habitat must be in physical contact with the planemo — orbiting platforms do not render a planemo parahabitable.
 
 In cases where either term applies, I'll often use the nomenclature *(para)habitable*.
 
 > **Hippy**: So, a *world* is a *planemo*, but a *planemo* isn't necessarily a *world*?

Oh, Hi, Hippy!  I didn't know you were here!  Friends, this is Hiparistarchus Ptolemeus Galileopernicum (Hippy to his friends — though he pretends not to like the nickname).

Yes, Hippy; that is a very good distinction.  All *worlds* are *planemos*, but not all *planemos* are *worlds*.  That is a good way to remember it, thanks!

BUT... micromos _can_ be parahabitable.  Make sense?

> **Keppy**: Through the use of artificial living environments, right?  But that would depend on the rest of the planemo's conditions, wouldn't it?  I mean, if it's a lava planemo, it would probably need airborne habitats, rather than surface ones?

Aaaand, here's Keppy (Keplarius Braheus), right on cue.

Yes, Keppy; it can get to be a fuzzy definition — but that's really the fun of it.  You're not locked-in to a narrow set of choices... you can "fudge" as your needs require.

**Terminology Focus**

In much of the published astrophysical literature, the word "size" is often used ambiguously.  You'll often encounter a phrase like "an Earth-sized planemo".  _Most of the time_ "size" means radius, but on rare occasions, it is used to mean a planemo with the same _mass_ as Earth, which is a very different quality.  It's even worse when the word "big" is invoked... Does "this planemo is three times as big as Earth" mean "three times Earth's **radius**", or "three times Earth's **mass**"?

For our purposes, it is simpler to refer to the properties of a planemo in terms of multiples of the same property for Earth.  So while Earth's mass is ≈ 5.972 × 10²⁴ kg, we simply say that Earth has "one Earth-mass".

>  **Keppy**: If you'd *rather* memorize 5.972 × 10²⁴ kg, nobody's going to stop you, but 1.0 is a much easier number to remember, in my opinion.

My point exactly.  Earth's mass is ≈ 5.972 × 10²⁴ kg.  Mars' mass is ≈ 6.39 \times 10²³ kg.  Big numbers to carry around in your head.  But, if we divide Earth's mass by Mars' mass:

$$\dfrac{5.972 \times 10^{24}}{6.39 \times 10^{23}} \approx 0.107$$

... we find that Mars is about one-tenth as massive as Earth, which is a much easier fact to remember.  In the official literature you'll often see this written as "Mars has a mass of 0.107⨁", where ⨁ is the astronomical symbol for Earth. 

> **Keppy**: It's originally based on astrology, but astronomers don't like to talk about that.

Ahem, yes, well.... we'll use the same convention here: Earth's mass is 1.0⨁; Earth's radius is 1.0⨁; Earth's density is 1.0⨁ —

 > **Hippy**: _Wait a minute!_  They're _all_ 1.0⨁???  How do you know whether you're talking about mass or radius or density or ...?

Excellent point, Hippy!  Most of the time the context makes it clear which property is being referenced, but here are some ways we'll see it expressed:

- $M_{Mars}$ ≈ 0.107⨁
- M = 1.0⨁
- "... this would be around 4.25m⨁..."

And the same with radius, density, etc.:

- Mars' radius is ≈ 0.53⨁.
- Mars' density is ≈ 0.173⨁

You're already familiar with this but you may not be aware of it.  Astronauts will often talk about experiencing "5g of acceleration".  No, that's not the bandwidth of their phone's WiFi.  They mean that, for a time, they experienced **five times the gravity** we normally feel at the surface of the Earth.  Because this is so often abbreviated _g_, we'll do the same here with the understanding that 1.0g = 1.0g⨁.

Here are some other symbols that will be used in the same way:

- ⊙ = the Sun
- ☽ = the Moon
- ♃ = Jupiter

It might be helpful when seeing these symbols to think of them as standing for a corresponding descriptive term; for instance,

- ⨁ = the Earth, or "terran"
- ⊙ = the Sun, or "solar"
- ☽ = the Moon, or "lunar"
- ♃ = Jupiter, or "jovian"

So when you see something like "Mars' radius is ≈ 0.53⨁", read it as "Mars' radius is ≈ 0.53 *terran*."  Other examples:

- The mass of the Sun is ≈ 333000⨁: "The mass of the Sun is ≈ 333000 *terran*."
- The radius of the Moon is ≈ 0.2727⨁: "The radius of the Moon is ≈ 0.2727 *terran*."
- The mass of Ceres is ≈ 0.0128☽: "The mass of Ceres is ≈ 0.0128 *lunar*."

We say this is expressing these parameters in ***relative*** terms — how the parameter relates to the same parameter of another known body (the **standard**) —, rather than in ***absolute*** terms, such as kilometers, grams, g/cm³, or m/sec².

For instance, the Earth's density in **absolute** terms is ≈ 5.515 g/cm³; in **relative** terms it is 1.0⨁.  To arrive at the relative value for a body, divide the absolute value of its given parameter by the absolute value of the same parameter for the standard: e.g.,
$$\rho ☽ ≈ \dfrac{3.344 \space gm/cm^3}{5.514 \space gm/cm^3} ≈ 0.606\oplus$$
### Bigger and Heavier

Most of the time, we'll talk about planemo masses and radii in relative terms, but in colloquial discourse we might find ourselves simply wanting to, say, compare Mercury and Ganymede by mass and radius.

|          | Mass   | Radius  |
| -------- | ------: | -------: |
| Mercury  | 0.055⨁ | 0.3829⨁ |
| Ganymede | 0.025⨁ | 0.413⨁  |
Mercury's mass is greater than that of Ganymede but Ganymede's radius is greater than Mercury's.  Thus we might simply say "Mercury is *heavier* than Ganymede, but Ganymede is *bigger* than Mercury."  While the terms "bigger" and "heavier" are non-technical, they are easily understandable in casual parlance.

 > **Hippy**: But "heavier" is a relative measure of **weight** — which is _mass under gravity_.   Mass and weight are _not_ the same thing.

No; they are not.  And that is why I took this moment to explain.  We're exercising a little _sed ego dico_, here, relative (pun intended) to nomenclature.
