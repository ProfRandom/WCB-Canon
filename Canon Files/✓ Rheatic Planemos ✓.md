> _Rheatics_ are **parahabitable** planemos — terrestrial super-Earths with conditions **favorable to rich biospheres** but likely **inhospitable to unmodified humans**. They may possess higher surface gravity, thicker atmospheres, and more energetic climates, often demanding mechanical, biological, or infrastructural adaptations for long-term Earthling presence. Nonetheless, they are considered highly conducive to complex, robust life — just not necessarily Earthlike.

**Overlap with Gaeans**:
- A **small subset** of Rheatics — **≈13.9%** — fall within the Gaean gravity range (0.9 ≤ g ≤ 1.1⨁).    
- These rare worlds are **massive and dense** enough to support Earth-normal surface conditions **while offering enhanced biospheric potential** — possibly the best of both worlds.
**Core Feature**:
- The **“superhabitable” zone**: larger size means broader climatic bands, more plate tectonics, greater magnetic shielding, and longer tectonic–volcanic cycling — all of which may favor biospheric richness and diversity.    
- **Human settlement** is plausible but typically **requires support**: enhanced structural design, medical mitigation of gravity effects, and climate regulation systems.
**Distinction from Geotics**:
- All Rheatics meet **Geotic** compositional constraints, but their **mass and gravity trends upward**.    
- **Not all Geotics** are Rheatic: Rheatics are a **subset of high-mass, dense, habitable** planemos.    
- Conversely, **not all Rheatics are Gaean** — only a small slice of them match that precise Earthlike window.
