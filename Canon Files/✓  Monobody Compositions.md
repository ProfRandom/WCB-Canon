## Abstract
**Major Topics:**  
- Monobody composition taxonomy (configuration classes).  
- Four primary categories: Lithic, Astatic, Aetheric, Ulsic.  
- Density ranges for Lithic, Astatic, and Aetheric.  
- Subclasses (conformations) within each category.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- Lithic → Petriform (silicate), Carboform (carbon).  
- Astatic → Pagoform (ice-rich), Fluxiform (liquid-dominated).  
- Aetheric → Transiform (gas dwarfs), Pneumoform (ice giants), Haliform (gas giants).  
- Ulsic → placeholder for exotic/degenerate matter (neutron stars, quark stars, black holes).  
- Densities expressed in g/cm³ and ⨁ (Earth-density units).  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Canon as of Glossary v1.217.  
- Complements **Monobody Mass Classes** (size taxonomy), creating a two-axis classification system (mass × composition).  
- “Haliform” here = Gas Giants → ensure no confusion with earlier Haliform (halogen-bearing lithic variant).  
- Overlaps with terms already staged in Glossary: Lithic, Astatic, Aetheric, Ulsic.

## Monobody Compositions

All monobodies should be thought of as falling roughly into one of four categories of ***configuration***:

1. ***Lithic*** (from Greek _lithos_ "stone, rock") – Fully solid planemos (rocky, carbon-rich, metallic elements).
2. ***Astatic*** (from Greek _a_ "not, none" + _status_ "state condition") – Mixed-phase planemos (icy, oceanic, or chemically altered worlds that have no fixed state).
3. ***Aetheric*** (from Latin _aer_ "air") – Gaseous planemos (gas dwarfs, ice giants, and gas giants).
4. ***Ulsic*** (from Latin _uls_ "beyond") – Exotic or theoretical matter planemos (placeholder for degenerate matter planemos — neutron stars, black holes, quark stars, etc. — if needed).

The first three compositions span specific **density** ranges:

1. **Lithic**: 3.5 g/cm³ – 8.0 g/cm³ (0.6347⨁ – 1.451⨁)
2. **Astatic**: 1.0 g/cm³ – <3.5 g/cm³ (0.1814⨁ – 0.6347⨁) 
3. **Aetheric**: 0.1 g/cm³ – 1.0 g/cm³ (0.0181⨁ – 0.1814⨁)

And each has subsets, called ***conformations***:

1. **Lithic**
	- ***Petriform***: Rocky, silicate-based planemos.
	- ***Carboform***: Carbon-dominated (graphite, diamond) planemos 
2. **Astatic**
	- ***Pagoform***: Ice-rich planemos (frozen volatiles like water, ammonia, methane, etc.)
	- ***Fluxiform***: Liquid-dominated planemos (H₂O, but also other volatiles)
3. **Aetheric**
	- ***Transiform***: Gas Dwarfs
	- ***Pneumoform***: Ice Giants
	- ***Haliform***: Gas Giants

These are intended to categorize monbodies_in their current configuration_.  A monobody may (usually will) assume different qualities depending on its age and environment.
