## Monobody Compositions

All monobodies should be thought of as falling roughly into one of four categories of ***configuration***:

1. ***Lithic*** (from Greek _lithos_ "stone, rock") – Fully solid planemos (rocky, carbon-rich, metallic elements).
2. ***Astatic*** (from Greek _a_ "not, none" + _status_ "state condition") – Mixed-phase planemos (icy, oceanic, or chemically altered worlds that have no fixed state).
3. ***Aetheric*** (from Latin _aer_ "air") – Gaseous planemos (gas dwarfs, ice giants, and gas giants).
4. ***Ulsic*** (from Latin _uls_ "beyond") – Exotic or theoretical matter planemos (placeholder for degenerate matter planemos — neutron stars, black holes, quark stars, etc. — if needed).

The first three compositions span specific **density** ranges:

1. **Lithic**: 3.5 g/cm³ – 8.0 g/cm³ (0.6347⨁ – 1.451⨁)
2. **Astatic**: 1.0 g/cm³ – <3.5 g/cm³ (0.1814⨁ – 0.6347⨁) 
3. **Aetheric**: 0.1 g/cm³ – 1.0 g/cm³ (0.0181⨁ – 0.1814⨁)

And each has subsets, called ***conformations***:

1. **Lithic**
	- ***Petriform***: Rocky, silicate-based planemos.
	- ***Carboform***: Carbon-dominated (graphite, diamond) planemos 
2. **Astatic**
	- ***Pagoform***: Ice-rich planemos (frozen volatiles like water, ammonia, methane, etc.)
	- ***Fluxiform***: Liquid-dominated planemos (H₂O, but also other volatiles)
3. **Aetheric**
	- ***Transiform***: Gas Dwarfs
	- ***Pneumoform***: Ice Giants
	- ***Haliform***: Gas Giants

These are intended to categorize monbodies_in their current configuration_.  A monobody may (usually will) assume different qualities depending on its age and environment.
