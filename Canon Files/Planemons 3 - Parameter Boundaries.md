## Abstract  1
**Major Topics:**  
- Simplified relationships among planemon parameters (m, ρ, g, r, vₑ) when one parameter is set to unity (Earth-normal).  
- Demonstrates that if **any two parameters equal 1 simultaneously, all five must equal 1**.  
- Provides worked equivalences for each “ground state” case:  
  - m = 1 → other parameters derived directly.  
  - ρ = 1 → r, g, vₑ equal; m is cube of these.  
  - g = 1 → central case; defines “paramount geotic worlds.”  
  - vₑ = 1 → ties radius, mass, and gravity.  
  - r = 1 → m, g, ρ equal; vₑ is their square root.  
- Highlights **paramount geotic worlds** as those with g = 1, i.e., Earth-normal gravity, yielding minimal physiological stress for humans.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **m** — planemon mass (⨁).  
- **ρ** — Density (⨁).  
- **g** — Surface gravity (⨁).  
- **r** — Radius (⨁).  
- **vₑ** — Escape velocity (⨁).  
- **Geotic Ground States** — Parameter configurations where one or more parameters equal unity.  
- **Paramount Geotic Worlds** — Worlds defined by g = 1, optimal for human habitation.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Expands the WCB **Core Parameter Precedence** framework by showing interdependencies in normalized form.  
- Emphasizes that g = 1 is not just a mathematical simplification but the **biological optimum** for hospitable worlds.  
- Serves as both a teaching tool (equation simplification) and a design guide (highlighting gravity’s primacy).  

## Abstract  2
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines two inner-boundary orbital constraints relative to stars:  
  - **Innermost Stable Limital (ISL):** Minimum orbit distance where a planemon’s orbit remains dynamically stable given the stellar radius and luminosity class.  
    - Formula: ISL ≈ k × R.  
    - k-values vary by luminosity class (e.g., 2–3 for main sequence, 15–25 for supergiants).  
  - **Critical Viability Limital (CVL):** Minimum orbit distance where stellar flux does not exceed the maximum tolerable level for animotic viability.  
    - Formula: CVL = √(L / Smax).  
    - Smax varies by motatype: endomota (2), xenomota (7.5), exomota (20→).  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **ISL** — Innermost Stable Limital.  
- **CVL** — Critical Viability Limital.  
- **R** — Stellar radius.  
- **k** — Luminosity-class multiplier.  
- **L** — Stellar luminosity (⊙).  
- **Smax** — Maximum tolerable stellar flux (motatype-dependent).  
- **Motatypes:**  
  - **Endomota** — conservative Terran-like biota (low flux tolerance).  
  - **Xenomota** — more radiation-tolerant life.  
  - **Exomota** — extreme-tolerance life.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- ISL ties orbital mechanics to stellar radius scaling.  
- CVL ties biological viability to stellar flux limits.  
- Both act as **inner habitability boundaries**, complementing habitable zone definitions (H₀–H₅).  

## Abstract 3
**Major Topics:**  
- Characteristics of a zero-obliquity (ε ≈ 0°) planet.  
- Climatic consequences: absence of seasons, uniform day length.  
- Astronomical consequences: no annual change in stellar altitude or apparent size.  
- Cultural/calendar implications: limited concept of “year,” reliance on lunar or stellar cycles.  
- Alternative mechanisms for “seasons” via high orbital eccentricity.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- ε = obliquity (axial tilt).  
- e = orbital eccentricity.  
- Periastron / Apastron distances (Rₘᵢₙ, Rₘₐₓ).  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Relates to glossary terms: obliquity (ε), eccentricity (e), periastron/apastron.  
- Complements **Orbital Eccentricity and Seasonal Effects.md** by exploring a special case.  
- Conceptual overlap with habitability/seasonality discussions in climate-related notes.  



## Geotic Ground States
If you assume a value of 1 for any of the basic parameters, the equations for the other parameters simplify, as enumerated below.

> **Note**: If **any two** core parameters equal 1 simultaneously, then **all** five must equal 1.
### Mass: m = 1
- $r=\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{g}}=\sqrt[3]{\dfrac{1}{\rho}}=\dfrac{1}{v_e^2}$
- $\rho=\dfrac{1}{r^3}=\sqrt{g^3}=v_e^6$
- $g=\dfrac{1}{r^2}=\sqrt[3]{\rho^2}=v_e^4$
- $v_e=\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{r}}=\sqrt[4]{g}=\sqrt[6]{\rho}$
### Density: ρ = 1
- $r = g = v_e = \sqrt[3]{m}$
- $m=r^3=g^3=v_e^3$
- $g=r=\sqrt[3]{m}=v_e$
- $vₑ=g=r=\sqrt[3]{m}$
> > **Note**: When **ρ = 1**, the values of **radius** (*r*), **gravity** (*g*), and **escape velocity** (*vₑ*) are all numerically equal. The **mass** (*m​*) is the cube of any of them.
### Gravity: g = 1
- $m=r^2=\dfrac{1}{\rho^2}=v_e^4$
- $r=\dfrac{1}{\rho}=\sqrt{m}=v_e^2$
- $\rho=\dfrac{1}{r}=\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{m}}=\dfrac{1}{v_e^2}$
- $v_e=\sqrt{r}=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}=\sqrt[4]{m}$
### Escape Velocity: vₑ = 1
- $m=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}=\dfrac{1}{g}=r$
- $r=\dfrac{v_e}{\sqrt{\rho}}=\dfrac{1}{g}=m$
- $\rho=\dfrac{1}{r^2}=g^2=\dfrac{1}{m^2}$
- $g=\sqrt{\rho}=\dfrac{1}{r}=\dfrac{1}{m}$
### Radius: r = 1
- $m=g=\rho=v_e^2$
- $v_e=\sqrt{g}=\sqrt{\rho}=\sqrt{m}$
> > **Note**: When **r = 1**, the values of **mass** (*m*), **gravity** (*g*), and **density** (*ρ*) are all numerically equal. The **escape velocity** (*vₑ​*) is the square-root of any of them.

## Paramount Geotic Worlds
**The most Geotic worlds — that is, the worlds most naturally suited for Earthling-human life — are those with g = 1.**

> Since Earth-normal gravity determines everything from blood pressure to biomechanical stress, a surface gravity of 1g minimizes physiological strain and habitat adaptation needs.

If you set **mass** as your primary parameter, the others resolve as follows:
- $r=\sqrt{m}$
- $\rho=\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{m}}$
- $v_e=\sqrt[4]{m}$

Alternatively, if you begin by setting **density**, the remaining values are:
- $m=\dfrac{1}{\rho^2}$
- $r=\dfrac{1}{\rho}$
- $v_e=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}$

The equations above also allow determination of any of the three remaining parameters when two are initially set/chosen.

# A Zero-Obliquity Planet
## Basics
A planet with no axial tilt (or a very, very modest one — anything <2.5°)


- If eccentricity is low (e < 0.10), no major seasonal variation through the year.
- All days are the same length, everywhere, all year long.
- "Seasonal" constellations still occur, because the direction the "night side" of the planemon faces still changes as it orbits.
- No change in the size of the star in the sky during orbit.
- From a stellar standpoint, the concept of a "year" would be meaningless
	- ONLY changes like the slow rotation of the night sky from night to night, or the period of a major moon would be available for calendrical development.

### Alternative Methods Of Generating "Seasons"
#### Zero Obliquity With High Orbital Eccentricity
A planet with zero obliquity might experience something akin to seasons if it were on a highly elliptical orbit that carried it particularly close to and distant from the star at either periastron or apastron, or both.

Eccentricities in excess of 0.40 — which is _highly_ eccentric (Mercury's orbital eccentricity is 0.2056).

Depending on the configuration of the orbit, the planet might:
- Pass very close to the star at periastron
- Linger extremely distant from the star at apastron
- Experience both extremes on each orbit.

Orbital period would come into play, here, as well.  If the orbit is short in duration, these fluctuations might be experienced more as something like seasonal changes, whereas if the orbit is of long duration, they might be more climatological shifts over a span of years, or even centuries or millennia.

In the case of high orbital eccentricity, the apparent size of the star in the sky might become naked-eye noticeable.
