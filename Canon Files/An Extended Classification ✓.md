# X.01 — Proposal

> Please note that this is not in _any_ way meant to serve as a real-world planemo classification system, and real-world bodies likely exist that do not fit into this system.  I invoke _sed ego dico fictiae_: it's not meant to be "real", it's meant to be _useful_.

If you look online, particularly at the Exoplanet Catalog[^Exolog], you'll quickly see that there is a (frankly) bewildering variety of bodies described there, divided into five broad categories:

1. Terrestrial — Earth-mass and less
2. Super Earth — Earth-mass up to Neptune mass (< 17⨁)
3. Neptune-like — Upper mass value not clearly identified
4. Gas Giant —  Upper mass not specified, but other sources put the limit at ≈ 0.08⊙ ≈ 13♃ ≈ 4131⨁
5. Unknown (we know _something_ is there, but that's about it for now)

I highly recommend exploring it and marveling at the sheer variety the universe offers us; but, the thesiast is left still bereft of any kind of organized, categorical, systematic way of thinking about planemos that can guide their construction for fictional and experimental purposes.  

While the Exoplanet Catalog centers primarily on **mass**, this system uses those categories only as familiar **compositional metaphors**. Our classification instead prioritizes the **configuration** — the material nature and density regime — of a planemo as the _primary axis_ of distinction. Mass may inform surface gravity or escape velocity, but it is not the defining classifier here.

Using this as our starting point, I propose the following system.

[[Monobody Compositions ☐]]

[[Earth-like Planemos — What Does That Even Mean  ☐]]
