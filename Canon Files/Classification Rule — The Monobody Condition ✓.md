# Classification Rule â€” The Monobody Condition

> **All WBN â€“mo ontotypes (planemo, intermo, stellamo)** refer exclusively to **individual, gravitationally coherent bodies** â€” not to multi-body **systems**, **collections**, or **regions**.

### ðŸ”’ What *Is* a â€“mo
A **â€“mo** is defined by:
- A single **center of mass**  
- Internally unified **gravitational structure**  
- Physically continuous **volume** (or event horizon, in the case of black holes)  
- E.g., **planemos, intermos, stellamos, supermos, ultramos, hypermos**

### ðŸš« What _Is Not_ a â€“mo:
The following are **not â€“mo**, regardless of total mass:

| Category                | Example                          | Why Excluded                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Star Clusters**       | Globular clusters, open clusters | Multi-body systems               |
| **Nebulae / Clouds**    | Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs)    | Diffuse, non-contiguous          |
| **Galaxies**            | Milky Way, Andromeda             | Gravitationally bound aggregates |
| **Binary Systems**      | Sirius A+B, Plutoâ€“Charon         | Contain â‰¥2 centers of mass       |
| **Black Hole Binaries** | LIGO-detected pairs              | Still system-level               |
## **WBN Monobody Rule (Ontotype Scope Clarification)**

> **All -mo classifications (planemo, intermo, stellamo, cryptomo)** refer to **individual, contiguous, gravitationally self-bound objects**.
> 
> Multi-object systems â€” whether binary, ternary, or aggregate â€” are **not themselves -mos**, even if composed entirely of -mos.
### ðŸ§  Key Principles:
1. **Ontotype is not emergent**:  
    A **system of planemos** is not a larger planemo.  
    A **binary of stellamos** is not a single, larger stellamo.    
2. **Modeling convenience â‰  ontological unity**:    
    - For orbital mechanics, it's **useful** to model a binary pair as a single object of combined mass.        
    - But **ontotypically**, the barycentered abstraction is **not** a -mo.        
3. **Distinct gravitational fields**:    
    - A â€“mo has **one center of mass**, even if dynamic (e.g., fast-rotating planemo).        
    - A system has **multiple discrete gravitational centers**, even if mathematically reducible.
For instance in a double-star planemo system, it is convenient to treat the two stellamos as a single stellamo of their combined mass, centered on the barycenter of their orbits, but there are not an _object_ but a mathematical construct based on a property of the _system_ they comprise.
