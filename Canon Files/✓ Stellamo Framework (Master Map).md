## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines the **Stellamo Framework**, a master map for classifying **stellar monobodies (stellamos)**.  
- Structure:  
  - **Trunk (shared levels):**  
    - Frame → Monobody.  
    - Group → Stellamo.  
  - **Spectral Branch (surface physics):**  
    - Spectral Class (O–M).  
    - Spectral Subclass (decimal divisions, e.g. G2, M5).  
    - Spectral Type = Spectral Class + Luminosity Class (e.g. G2V, K3III).  
  - **Luminosity Branch (structural physics):**  
    - Luminosity Class (morphological categories by radius/brightness, 0–VII).  
    - Evolutionary Phase (Protostar → Main sequence → Giant → White dwarf → Remnant).  
- **Intersection Principle:**  
  - Spectral Branch = “what the star is” (temperature, spectrum, color).  
  - Luminosity Branch = “what the star does” (brightness, radius, life-cycle).  
  - **Spectral Type = intersection of both axes.**  
- Worked examples:  
  - Sun = G2V.  
  - Proxima Centauri = M5.5V.  
  - Rigel = B8Ia.  
  - Betelgeuse = M2Ia.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Stellamo [NEW]:** stellar monobody; root classification unit.  
- **Spectral Class/Subclass/Type [sci].**  
- **Luminosity Class [sci].**  
- **Evolutionary Phase [sci].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Spectral and luminosity classifications are already canonical.  
- **Stellamo [NEW]** is introduced here for the first time as a formal organizing term.  
- **Status:** [EXPANDED + NEW] — expands stellar classification into a dual-branch framework; introduces Stellamo as a new root concept.

# ⭐ Stellamo Framework (Master Map)
All **Stellamos** (stellar monobodies) share a **common trunk** — then branch into two complementary classification systems.

---
## 🌳 Trunk (Shared Levels)
- **Frame** → Monobody    
- **Group** → Stellamo   

---
## 🌈 Spectral Branch (Temperature / Spectrum)
Focus: **What the star _is_, by surface temperature and spectral features**
- **Spectral Class** → Broad categories (O, B, A, F, G, K, M)    
- **Spectral Subclass** → Decimal divisions within a class (e.g. G2, M5)    
- **Spectral Type** → Spectral Class + Luminosity Class (e.g. G2V, K3III)    

---
## 💡 Luminosity Branch (Structure / Evolutionary Stage)
Focus: **What the star _does_, by size, brightness, and life-cycle**
- **Luminosity Class** → Morphological grouping by stellar radius & brightness    
    - 0 = Hypergiant        
    - Ia/Iab/Ib = Supergiant        
    - II = Bright giant        
    - III = Giant        
    - IV = Subgiant        
    - V = Main sequence (dwarf)        
    - VI = Subdwarf        
    - VII = White dwarf
        
- **Evolutionary Phase** (optional refinement inside each class)    
    - Protostar → Main sequence → Giant → White dwarf → Remnant (NS/BH)
        
---
## 🔄 Intersections

- **Spectral Type** = Intersection of **Spectral Class/Subclass** with **Luminosity Class**    
    - Example: the Sun = **G2V** (Spectral Class G, subclass 2, Luminosity Class V).        
    - Proxima Centauri = **M5.5V**.        
    - Rigel = **B8Ia**.        

---
## 🧭 Principle
- **Spectral Branch** = _surface physics_ (temperature, color, composition).    
- **Luminosity Branch** = _structural physics_ (radius, brightness, lifecycle stage).    
- Both are **lateral axes**: their **intersection defines the star’s Spectral Type.**    

---

✅ Example:
- Sun = G (Class) → G2 (Subclass) → Luminosity V → **G2V Spectral Type**.    
- Betelgeuse = M (Class) → M2 (Subclass) → Luminosity Ia → **M2Ia Spectral Type**.
