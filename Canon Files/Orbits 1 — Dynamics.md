## Abstract 1
**Major Topics:**  
- Methods for placing and sizing asteroid belts between two major perturbers.  
- Calculation of belt extent: inner/outer orbits, asymmetric central orbit, systemic mass ratio, belt width.  
- Resonant orbit calculation using Kepler’s Third Law ($P^2 \propto a^3$).  
- Distinction between **tresonances** (trapping resonances) and **gresonances** (gap-opening resonances).  
- Resonance scalers and their observed roles in Kirkwood gaps.  
- Gap width justification and minimum perturber mass (≥ 0.333⨁ for solar case).  
- Example Kirkwood gap analogues.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- $a_i$, $a_o$ = inner/outer orbit distances.  
- $m_i$, $m_o$ = inner/outer planemon masses (Terrans).  
- $M_*$ = stellar mass (Terrans; 333,000 M⊙).  
- $a_c$, Δa, $a_s$, $a_\Delta$ = derived orbital metrics.  
- $m_\mu$ = systemic mass ratio.  
- $W_{belt}$, $W_i$, $W_o$, $B_i$, $B_o$ = belt width and edge measures.  
- Tresonance = trapping resonance.  
- Gresonance = gap-opening resonance.  
- $P_i$, $P_o$, $P_x$ = periods of perturber and resonance.  
- $a_x$ = resonant distance.  
- $g_w$, $g_{quad}$ = gap width measures.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Resonance framework builds on **Mean Motion Resonance** note.  
- Tresonance vs. Gresonance terminology is WCB-specific.  
- Gap resonance ratios (e.g., 2:1, 3:1, 5:2) match observed Solar System Kirkwood gaps.  
- Trap resonance ratios (e.g., 3:2, 4:3) match stabilizing locations (e.g., Hilda asteroids).  
- Canonical distinction: gap resonances = frequency > 1.5, trap resonances = frequency ≤ 1.5.  
- Belt placement formulas integrate with broader Orbit Design Methods.

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Canonical terminology: *periastron/apastron* with Rₘᵢₙ/Rₘₐₓ for star–planemon systems.  
- Deprecated symbols: ß, rₚ, rₐ (legacy only).  
- Ḋ introduced in Glossary v1.211 as preferred WCB metric.  
- Overlaps conceptually with orbital design/insolation notes; interacts with climate/habitability discussions.  

## Abstract  5
**Major Topics:**  
- Provides a **qualitative, sky-map based method** for estimating when the Sun passes behind planetary rings.  
- Uses **ring arcs (fixed for latitude)** and the **Sun’s declination path (variable by apical chronum)** to identify shadow events.  
- Outlines shadow scenarios:  
  - No occlusion.  
  - Partial occlusion (single crossing).  
  - Double crossing.  
  - Special equator–equinox case (Sun aligned with ring plane all day, but negligible effect due to Sun’s disc width).  
- Explains how **timing of shadow events** drifts seasonally: stable near solstices, rapid shifts near equinoxes.  
- Discusses **climate implications** of ring shading: reduced insolation, altered convection, possible cooling effects, and role as “life-saving parasols.”  
- Stresses limits of rigor: exact modeling requires advanced orbital climatology; this guide provides **worldbuilding-level approximations**.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Apical chronum [neo].**  
- **Diurn [neo].**  
- **Declination (δ) [sci].**  
- **Latitude (λ) [sci].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Builds directly on **Calculating Stellar Sky Paths**: applies its solar path framework to ring–Sun interactions.  
- Reinforces canonical use of **apical chronum** and **diurn**.  
- Uses standard astronomical terms: **declination, latitude**.  
- No new symbolic conventions introduced.  
- **Status:** [EXPANDED] — broadens existing canon by applying sky-path methods to planetary ring shading and climate effects.

## Calculating Resonant Orbits
### Vocabulary Notes
- Perturber: An orbiting object acting to perturb the orbit of other, less massive nearby objects.
- Perturbant: The body exerting perturbing influence.
- Resonant: Any of the resonances that result from the influence of the perturbant.
- Tresonance: A resonance tending to trap orbiting bodies within a narrow orbital region.
- Gresonance: A resonance tending to exclude orbiting bodies from a narrow orbital region.

When mapping resonant gap orbits, use the bracketing orbits as **perturbers**. For each perturber, resonances can be found by scaling the orbital period with small integer ratios and converting back to distance with Kepler’s Third Law ($P^2 \propto a^3$).

1. When both perturbers have equal mass ($m_i = m_o$) calculate resonance orbits only from the mass and orbital distance of the outer perturber.
2. When the perturbers have differenting masses:
	- If their mass ratio ≤ 10:1, calculate resonance orbits for both inner and outer perturbers and pairwise-average them.
	- If their mass ratio > 10:1, calculate resonance orbits using only the mass and orbital distance of the more massive perturber (regardless of location).
### Inner Orbit Resonances
Using the **inner perturber** with period $P_i$.  
$$
P_x = P_i \times k \quad \text{Where: } k \in \{1.67, 2.00, 2.25, 2.33, 2.50, 2.67, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 5.00\}
$$$$
a_x = \sqrt[3]{P_x^2 \, M\odot}
$$ Where:
- $P_x$ = resonant period  
- $a_x$ = resonant distance (AU)  
- $M\odot$ = stellar mass (in solar units)  
- $k$ = resonance scaler (see below for details)  

***Keep only values where $a_x > B_i$ (beyond the inner orbit).***  
### Outer Orbit Resonances
Using from the **outer perturber** with period $P_o$.  
$$
P_x = \frac{P_o}{k} \quad \text{Where: } k \in \{1.67, 2.00, 2.25, 2.33, 2.50, 2.67, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 5.00\}
$$$$
a_x = \sqrt[3]{P_x^2 \, M\odot}
$$Where:
- $P_x$ = resonant period  
- $a_x$ = resonant distance (AU)  
- $M\odot$ = stellar mass (in solar units)  
- $k$ = resonance scaler  

***Keep only values where $a_x < B_o$ (inside the outer orbit).***  
#### Combined Equation Forms:

##### Inner Orbit Resonances
$$
\begin{aligned}
a_x &= \sqrt[3]{\Big((P_i \times k)^2 \, M\odot\Big)} \\[0.5em]
 \text{Where: } k &\in \{1.67, 2.00, 2.25, 2.33, 2.50, 2.67, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 5.00\}
\end{aligned}
$$
##### Outer Orbit Resonances
$$
\begin{aligned}
a_x &= \sqrt[3]{\left(\frac{P_o}{k}\right)^2 M\odot} \\[0.5em]
 \text{Where: } k &\in \{1.67, 2.00, 2.25, 2.33, 2.50, 2.67, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 5.00\}

> **Notes:**
> 1. The higher the resonant order, the weaker the resonance.
> 2. It is worth noting that all gap resonances have frequencies > 1.50 and all trap resonances have frequencies ≤ 1.50.
> 3. Resonance 2:1 is the only first-order gap resonance, though it can, under certain circumstances, behave as a trap resonance.
> 4. These resonance ratios are all observed in the Solar System asteroid belt, though the framework is generalizable to other systems.

>**Usage:**
>Preferentially choose resonance ratios with order 1 or 2 whenever possible: resonances of order 1 or 2 will have the strongest dynamical signatures (clear gaps or stable traps). Higher orders may be used sparingly to add fine structure, but their effects will be much weaker.

# Width of Gaps
## Justification
For a resonance gap in an asteroid belt to be significant, it should be ≥ 0.1% of the orbital radius of the gap, itself.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{m_p}{M_*} ≥ 10^{-6} \\
\therefore m_p ≥ \frac{M_*}{10^6}
\end{aligned}
$$
Where:
- $m_{p}$ = the mass of the perturber in Terrans
- $M_*$ = the mass of the star in Terrans
-        = 333000 × the mass of the star in solar units ($M_\odot$)

### Example:
Given: $M_* = 333000 M_⨁ = 333000(1)$ (for the Sun):
$$
m_p ≥ \frac{333000}{10^6} = 0.333 m_⨁
$$
**Meaning:**
- A body must be **at least 0.333 Earth masses** (~⅓⨁) to carve a **recognizable Kirkwood gap** in a main-belt analogue.
- **Below this** (midimons, small planemons), the “gap width” is so narrow it doesn’t register as a true Kirkwood void.
## Calculating Gap Widths
For each resonant orbit calculated above, calculate a gap width by:
$$
g_w = a \times \sqrt{\frac{m_i + m_o}{333000M⊙}} \qquad \text{Preferred method}
$$
or
$$
\begin{aligned}
g_{quad} = \sqrt{g_i^2 + g_o^2} \qquad \text{Requires calculating $g_i$ and $g_o$ first by:} \\[1em]
g_i = a \times \sqrt{\frac{m_i}{333000M⊙}} \quad\text{and}\quad g_o = a \times \sqrt{\frac{m_o}{333000M⊙}}
\end{aligned}
$$
Both methods are algebraically equivalent: the $g_{quad}$ form expands ***exactly*** into the $g_w$ expression:
$$
g_{quad} = \sqrt{g_i^2 + g_o^2} = \sqrt{\left(a^2 \frac{m_i}{M_*}\right) + \left(a^2 \frac{m_o}{M_*}\right)} = a \times \sqrt{\frac{m_i + m_o}{M_*}} = g_w \; \checkmark
$$

# Harmonic Periods


_Harmonic periods_ are crucial for understanding how a planet's rotational and orbital cycles synchronize.  The harmonic period $H$ is the time interval over which the two independent motions align in their periodicity.
$$
H = \dfrac{P_1 \times P_2}{|P_1 - P_2|}
$$
Where:
- $P_1$ = length of the solar day
- $P_2$ = length of the sidereal day
- $H$ = harmonic period

> Yes, this is actually the same equation as the synodic period.

## Example
Using Earth's solar day and sidereal day:
$$
\begin{array}{l l}
P_1 = 86400^s &\text{solar day}\\
P_2 = 86164.090531^s &\text{sidereal day}
\end{array}
\begin{aligned}
\begin{split}
H &= \dfrac{P_1 \times P_2}{|P_1 - P_2|} \\[0.5em]
&= \dfrac{86400 \times 86164.090531}{|86400 - 86164.090531|} \\[0.5em]
&= \dfrac{7444577422}{235.9094692} \\[0.5em]
H &= 31556924.9854376^s\; \checkmark
\end{split}
\end{aligned}
$$
… we find that the harmonic period between the solar day and the sidereal day is approximately the length of the _tropical year_, differing from the official value of $31556925.216^s$ by an excess of only $0.2306^s$.

Similarly, calculating the harmonic period between Earth's solar day and the _stellar day_:

$$
\begin{array}{l l}
P_1 = 86400^s &\text{solar day}\\
P_2 = 86164.0989^s &\text{stellar day}
\end{array}
\begin{aligned}
\begin{split}
H &= \dfrac{P_1 \times P_2}{|P_1 - P_2|} \\[0.5em]
&= \dfrac{86400 \times 86164.0989}{|86400 - 86164.0989|} \\[0.5em]
&= \dfrac{7444578145}{235.901096} \\[0.5em]
H &= 31558048.1047344^s\; \checkmark
\end{split}
\end{aligned}
$$
… a difference of only $101.65737^s$ longer than the official length of the _sidereal year_: $31558149.7635456^s$.




# Orbit Randomization Notation
This symbolic system defines how to procedurally generate a sequence of orbital radii using randomized multiplicative (or divisive) steps from a baseline (**basal**) value. It distinguishes between **intrabasal** (moving inward) and **extrabasal** (moving outward) orbit generation.

The notation is fully symbolic and compatible with WCB's randomization and range assignment grammar.


**Intrabasal**
$$
r_i = B;\; \Omega = \text{«▢»}: \qquad
r_{i-1} = \frac{r_i}{⟨⟨ \text{min} ∧ \text{max} ⟩⟩}
\quad \text{while } r_i ≥ \Omega
$$

**Extrabasal**
$$
r_i = B;\; \Omega = \text{«▢»}: \qquad
r_{i+1} = r_i \cdot ⟨⟨ \text{min} ∧ \text{max} ⟩⟩
\quad \text{while } r_i ≤ \Omega
$$
Where:
- B = basal orbital radius (e.g. the nucleal orbit $\mathcal{N}$)
- Ω = orbital distance cuttoff (minimum or maximum allowed orbit based on the star system constraints)

## 🔄 Usage Strategy

The **intrabasal** and **extrabasal** forms can be used independently depending on your desired anchoring strategy:

- 🧭 **Outward-Only Generation**  
  If you begin at the **innermost permissible orbit** (e.g. a thermal, Roche, or design constraint), use the **extrabasal** form to expand outward via multiplicative steps:
$$
  r_0 = «inner limit»;\; L = «system edge»:
  \quad r_{i+1} = r_i \cdot ⟨⟨min ∧ max⟩⟩, \text{ while } r_{i+1} ≤ L
$$
- 🧭 **Outward-Only Generation**  
  If you begin at the **outermost permissible orbit** (e.g. a thermal or design constraint), use the **extrabasal** form to expand outward via multiplicative steps:
$$
  r_0 = «inner limit»;\; L = «system edge»:
  \quad r_{i-1} = \dfrac{r_i} {⟨⟨min ∧ max⟩⟩}, \text{ while } r_{i+1} ≤ L
$$

> Either method can fully define a system — or both can be combined with a central anchor (e.g. nucleal orbit) to scaffold a bidirectional structure.



# Orbital Eccentricity and Seasonal Effects

For a planemon orbiting a star (M₂ ⋘ M₁):
- **Periastron distance**:  
$$
 R_{min} = \mathcal{A}(1 - e)
$$
- **Apastron distance**:  
$$
 R_{max} = \mathcal{A}(1 + e)
$$
Where **𝒜** is the *average orbital separation* between the bodies.  
When describing a planemon’s orbit, 𝒜 corresponds to the **semimajor axis** of its elliptical path.  
## Fractional Distance Asymmetry (Ḋ)
The dimensionless measure of how much closer the planemon is at periastron than at apastron:
$$
\dot{D} = \frac{R_{max}}{R_{min}} - 1 = \frac{2e}{1-e}
$$
- Earth ($e = 0.0167$):  
  $\dot{D} \approx 0.034$ → **3.4% closer at periastron**  
- Rosetta ($e = 0.05$):  
  $\dot{D} \approx 0.105$ → **10.5% closer at periastron**

## Flux Ratio
Because stellar flux $F ∝ 1/R^2$, the insolation contrast between periastron and apastron is:
$$
\frac{F_{min}}{F_{max}} = \left(\frac{R_{max}}{R_{min}}\right)^2
$$
- Earth ($e = 0.0167$):  
  $\dfrac{F_{min}}{F_{max}} \approx 1.068$ → **6.8% stronger insolation at periastron**  
- Rosetta ($e = 0.05$):  
  $\dfrac{F_{min}}{F_{max}} \approx 1.23$ → **23% stronger insolation at periastron**

## WCB Note

- **Distance form (Ḋ)** → intuitive “how much closer/farther” language.  
- **Flux form ($F_{min}/F_{max}$)** → climatic impact (“how much hotter/colder”).  
- **Canonical terminology**: use *periastron/apastron* with *Rₘᵢₙ*/*Rₘₐₓ* in star–planemon systems.

### **Quick Method for Ring Shadows (Approximation)**  

*This section presents a simplified, diagram-based way to estimate when and how the Sun may pass behind a planet’s rings. It avoids complex spherical trigonometry by using sky maps and focuses on qualitative visualization.*  

When considering ring shadows on a terrestrial planet, the exact math quickly becomes too complex for this guide. However, you can **approximate** the effect using a sky-map method:  

1. **Choose observer latitude (\(\lambda\)):**  
   - For that latitude, the **ring arcs (inner and outer edges)** are constant in the sky. They do *not* change with season.  

2. **Plot the ring:**  
   - Draw the inner and outer arcs of the ring plane on a flattened sky chart (altitude vs. azimuth).  

3. **Plot the Sun’s path for the day:**  
   - The Sun’s diurnal arc depends on its **declination (\(\delta\))** for that day in the apical chronum.  
   - This sets its rising/setting azimems and maximum noon altitude.  

4. **Look for intersections:**  
   - Where the Sun’s path crosses the inner/outer ring arcs = entry/exit points into ring shadow.  

5. **Estimate time in shadow:**  
   - The **horizontal (azimuthal) component** of these intersection points tells you what **fraction of the diurn** the Sun spends behind the rings.  
   - The **vertical (altitude) component** confirms whether the Sun actually overlaps the ring band at all.  


**Key Insight:**  
- **Ring placement/width = fixed** for a given latitude.  
- **Sun’s path = variable** with declination.  
- **Shadow events** = when/where those two systems overlap.  

This gives a practical, diagram-based way to visualize daily ring shadow effects *without* diving into spherical trig.  


### **Ring Shadow Scenarios**

*Here we outline the possible daily patterns of ring-shadow events (none, partial, double crossing, special equator–equinox case). These scenarios are the observable outcomes of the Quick Method.*  

The following scenarios illustrate how the Sun’s path and the fixed ring arcs can interact, producing different shadowing outcomes through the day:  

1. **No Occlusion**  
   - The Sun’s daily path lies entirely outside the ring band.  
   - The Sun rises and sets south (or north) of the rings and never passes behind them.  

2. **Partial Occlusion**  
   - The Sun’s path intersects the ring band once.  
   - The Sun rises outside the rings, passes behind them for part of the day, then emerges before setting.  

3. **Double Crossing**  
   - The Sun’s path passes through the ring band twice.  
   - The Sun rises outside the rings, passes behind them, emerges above them near noon, and then passes behind again before setting.  

4. **Never Entirely Occluded**  
   - Because the ring arcs converge to points at east and west horizons, the Sun always begins and ends the day outside the rings.  
   - Thus, the Sun cannot be fully hidden for the entire diurn under normal circumstances.  


### **Special Case: Equator at Equinox**

- At the planetary equator during equinoxes, the Sun’s path coincides with the ring plane.  
- The Sun rises due east, passes overhead at zenith, and sets due west along the same great circle as the rings.  
- In this alignment, the Sun is “behind” the ring plane all day.  
- However, since the rings have a much narrower angular width on the sky than the Sun’s disc, the effect is negligible: no significant dimming or shadowing would be seen by surface observers.  


### **Ring Shadow Climate Effects**

*Dense or opaque rings can noticeably reduce insolation at the surface. This section considers how such shading might alter daily temperatures, weather cycles, and even settlement patterns, without attempting full climate modeling.*  

Where rings are dense enough, these shadow scenarios can affect not just what the sky looks like, but also how much solar energy reaches the ground. If a planetary ring is dense or optically thick, its shadow can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the surface whenever the Sun passes behind it. The severity of the effect depends on how much of the Sun’s disc is obscured and for how long.


#### **At the Subsolar Point**
- Shadowing is most direct when the Sun is highest in the sky.  
- Significant daily shading here could:  
  - Lower peak surface temperatures.  
  - Delay or reduce convection cycles (e.g., thunderstorm formation, monsoon timing).  
  - Alter evaporation rates and precipitation.  


#### **Seasonal & Locational Consequences**
- The Sun’s path shifts with the **apical chronum** (season).  
- Some regions may experience **daily shading during summer**, providing relief from heat.  
- Other regions may be **unshaded in winter** when the Sun’s path lies outside the ring band.  
- Higher latitudes may see the shadow zone migrate poleward or equatorward with the seasons.  


#### **Life-Saving Respite**
In especially hot climates, rings could act as natural **parasols**.  
- Example: A city in a desert belt might be survivable only because, during the hottest months, the Sun passes behind the rings from late morning until early afternoon each day.  
- Such shading could literally determine where civilizations thrive.  


#### **Complexity Warning**
Modeling this rigorously requires:  
- Optical depth of the rings.  
- Fraction of the Sun’s disc blocked during occultation.  
- Duration of shadow events.  
- Seasonal variation of these durations.  
- Climate feedback (albedo, heat storage, cloud dynamics).  

This is **well beyond the scope** of this guide. For worldbuilding purposes, simply note:  

> Rings can alter daily and seasonal insolation patterns, sometimes dramatically.  
> Authors may invoke rings as life-saving parasols, or as sources of seasonal hardship.  


### **Timing Behavior of Ring Shadows**

*Ring-shadow events happen at predictable times of day that drift seasonally. This section explains how those timings remain stable near solstices and shift quickly near equinoxes, echoing the familiar pattern of sunrise and sunset changes.*  

The qualitative outcomes above happen at specific times of day. These timings drift in a predictable seasonal pattern as the Sun’s declination changes:  

- The **ring arcs** are fixed in the sky for any given latitude.  
- The **Sun’s path** shifts gradually with the apical chronum (season), so the entry/exit times of shadow events drift over the year.  

**Seasonal Pattern:**  
- **Near solstices:** Declination changes slowly → shadow timings remain nearly constant, varying by only a minute or two over several weeks.  
- **Near equinoxes:** Declination changes rapidly → shadow timings shift more noticeably, sometimes by several minutes per day.  

This mirrors the familiar seasonal drift of sunrise and sunset times.  


### **Reality Check**

*Here we step back to emphasize limits. While ring shadows can be imagined, described, and even mapped in principle, exact calculations require advanced modeling. This guide provides qualitative tools and approximations for worldbuilding, not rigorous orbital climatology.*  

Ring shadows are:  
- **Imaginable** → the geometry can be pictured.  
- **Describable** → qualitative scenarios (no shadow, partial shadow, double crossing, equator–equinox exception) are clear.  
- **Theoretically mappable** → with spherical trig and patience, one could chart exact entry/exit times for any latitude, date, and ring geometry.  

But this is **not back-of-the-envelope work.**  
- It is **not coffee-break math.**  
- It requires **dedicated modeling** (great-circle geometry + spherical trigonometry + seasonal solar motion).  

**Worldbuilding takeaway:**  
Use the qualitative scenarios and the Quick Method approximation for storytelling. Exact computations belong to advanced orbital mechanics or climate modeling, not casual reference.
