## Earth-like Planemos: What Does That Even Mean?

Let's revisit the _physical properties_ of planemos:
![[Physical Properties of Planets ✓]]

We have established that Earth is our standard, and that its _relative_ mass is 1.0M⨁, its _relative_ radius is 1.0R⨁, etc.  But here are its _absolute_ parameters

**Mass**: 5.972 × 10²⁴ kg
**Radius**: 6371 km
**Density**: 5.514 g/cm³
**Surface Gravity**: 9.8 m/sec²
**Escape Velocity**: 11.186 km/sec

Sadly, but perhaps predictably, there is no generally agreed-upon definition of what makes a planemo "Earth-like", beyond either a loosely defined range of physical parameters or a rather more rigid set of environmental conditions.
