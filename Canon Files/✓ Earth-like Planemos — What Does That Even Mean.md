## Abstract
**Major Topics:**  
- Exploration of what defines an “Earth-like” planemo.  
- Reference baseline: Earth’s absolute physical parameters (mass, radius, density, gravity, escape velocity).  
- Lack of consensus in astrophysics: ranges vs. environmental conditions.  
- Distinction between **physical similarity** and **habitability classifications** (habitable, parahabitable, hospitable, xenotic, exotic).  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- m = mass (Earth: 5.972 × 10²⁴ kg).  
- r = radius (Earth: 6371 km).  
- ρ = density (Earth: 5.514 g/cm³).  
- g = surface gravity (Earth: 9.8 m/s²).  
- vₑ = escape velocity (Earth: 11.186 km/s).  
- “Earth-like” = physical conformity, not animosustent criteria.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Reinforces WCB convention: lowercase symbols (m, r) for planemo parameters.  
- Distinguish clearly between **Earth-like (physical)** and **animocentric classifications** (habitable, parahabitable, hospitable, xenotic, exotic).  
- Connects to glossary entries: animosustent (canon v1.21), planemo parameters.  
- Prevent conflation of “Earth-like” with life-supporting qualities.

## Earth-like Planemos: What Does That Even Mean?

Let's revisit the _physical properties_ of planemos:
![[Physical Properties of Planets ✓]]

We have established that Earth is our standard, and that its _relative_ mass is 1.0M⨁, its _relative_ radius is 1.0R⨁, etc.  But here are its _absolute_ parameters

**Mass**: 5.972 × 10²⁴ kg
**Radius**: 6371 km
**Density**: 5.514 g/cm³
**Surface Gravity**: 9.8 m/sec²
**Escape Velocity**: 11.186 km/sec

Sadly, but perhaps predictably, there is no generally agreed-upon definition of what makes a planemo "Earth-like", beyond either a loosely defined range of physical parameters or a rather more rigid set of environmental conditions.
