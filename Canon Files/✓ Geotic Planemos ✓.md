> _Geotics_ are **habitable** planemos — terrestrial-class worlds where humans can survive and thrive with minimal adaptation. These planemos fall within a broader Earth-like envelope, allowing a wider range of environmental and structural conditions than Gaeans, while remaining physically and biologically viable for Earth-based life. Atmospheric processing, infrastructure, or selective location may be required, but **shirtsleeve environments** are still plausible.

**Core Feature**:
- _Density bounds_ are kept narrow to ensure terrestrial composition (i.e., rocky–metallic silicate structure), but mass and radius are permitted greater variation, producing a range of surface gravities and escape velocities still compatible with Earth-based life — particularly plants, microbes, and well-supported human habitation.   
**Implication**:
- Geotics may include:    
    - **Marginal Earth-twins** (on the edges of Gaean parameters)        
    - **High-gravity super-Earths** (with greater landmass and thicker atmospheres)        
    - **Cooler, lighter Earthlikes** (with lower pressure and gravity, but survivable biospheres)
**Geotic ≠ Gaean**:
- All **Gaean** worlds are a _subset_ of Geotics.    
- But Geotics may include conditions beyond optimal comfort — requiring adaptation or technology to sustain human colonization.
