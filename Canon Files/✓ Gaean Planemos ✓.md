> _Gaeans_ are **hospitable** planemos — worlds whose surface environments require no special adaptation for unaided human life. They maintain **Earth-normal gravity** (⟨0.90 ∧ 1.10⟩⨁), and all other physical parameters — mass, radius, density, and escape velocity — fall within tightly Earthlike bounds. These planemos support **shirtsleeve conditions**: humans can breathe the air, walk freely on the surface, and survive long-term without technological intervention.

### Gaean Worlds and the Gravity One Corridor
Gaean worlds are **hospitable** by definition — capable of supporting unmodified human life on the surface. But more than that, their defining feature is a surface gravity **within ±10% of Earth’s**, or:
* 0.90 ≤ g ≤ 1.10 (in Earth gravities)
#### The Gravity One Corridor
This range centers on what we call the **Gravity One Corridor** — the precise locus of all planemo configurations (_mass–density pairs_) that yield **surface gravity = 1.000⨁**.

![[The_Gravity_One_Corridor.png]]
This narrow but critical pathway through parameter space defines the zone of optimal human comfort, physiology, architecture, and biomechanical function.

> When **g = 1.000⨁**, everything else — escape velocity, radius, and structural density — falls into predictable and manageable ranges.

As shown in the diagram:
- Planetary **mass (m)** and **density (ρ)** balance precisely to maintain **g = 1**.    
- The resulting values for:    
    - **Radius (r)** range from ~0.85⨁ to 1.25⨁        
    - **Escape velocity (vₑ)** from ~0.70⨁ to 1.30⨁        
- This corridor provides an ideal baseline from which all other habitable world classes are derived.
#### Why This Matters
Approximately 17.7% of all Geotics fall **within or near** the Gravity One Corridor. Deviating too far from it — even if mass and radius are "in range" — results in a world that is:
- Less biomechanically comfortable    
- More energetically expensive to escape    
- More geostructurally unstable    
- More challenging to terraform or sustain
In short:
> **The closer a world hugs the Gravity One Corridor, the easier it is to call home.**
