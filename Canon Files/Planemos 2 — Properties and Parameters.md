## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **five fundamental physical properties** of planemos:  
  - **Mass (m):** total matter present (distinct from weight).  
  - **Density (ρ):** matter per unit volume, affected by composition and gravitational compression.  
  - **Radius (r):** center-to-surface distance, treated as emergent from mass and density.  
  - **Surface Gravity (g):** acceleration at the surface, dependent on mass and radius.  
  - **Escape Velocity (v):** minimum speed to overcome gravity, also dependent on mass and radius.  
- Explains **interdependence**: radius emergent from mass and density, density altered by gravitational compression, gravity and escape velocity derived from the mass–radius relationship.  
- Notes **inverse-square law** as foundation for gravitational effects.  
- Invokes **sed ego dico** as an editorial simplification, prioritizing usability over perfect physical rigor.  
- Provides real-world analogies (e.g., water vs. iron density) to clarify concepts.

## Parameter Ranges by Spectral Class

**Abstract:**  
This file presents a tabulated set of **stellar parameters by spectral class (O–M)**, with high, mean, and low values given for each. Parameters included are:  

- **Effective temperature (K)**  
- **Thermal Interval Constant (þ)** — the step size in Kelvin that defines subclass increments  
- **Temperature (T⊙)** relative to the Sun  
- **Radius (R⊙)** relative to the Sun  
- **Luminosity (L⊙)** relative to the Sun  
- **Mass (M⊙)** relative to the Sun  
- **Frequency (Q⊙)** relative to the Sun  

The table serves as a **ready reference for stellar design** in worldbuilding, allowing thesiasts to quickly identify plausible ranges of physical values across the standard stellar sequence. It systematizes how subclass divisions are calculated (using the TIC, þ) and provides both absolute and relative values for major stellar quantities.  

**Canon Links:**  
- Connects to **Spectral Classes, Types, and Parameters** (M002 Stars series).  
- Uses the **Thermal Interval Constant (þ) [neo]** as defined elsewhere in WCB.  
- Values support calculations in **Habitable Zones**, **Fundamental Orbits**, and related stellar-orbital frameworks.  

**Lexical Tags:**  
- **[sci]** Spectral Classes, Tempera

## Physical Properties of Planemos

There are five properties of planemos that can be thought of as _physical properties_ — insofar as they describe the planemo physically or a property of the planemo that emerges from the other physical properties.  These are:

1. ***Mass*** (m):  The total amount of matter present. (_Mass and weight are not the same — weight depends on gravity; mass does not_.)
2. ***Density*** (ρ):  The average amount of matter per unit volume — essentially, how tightly packed the planemo’s materials are. This depends on both composition (e.g. rock, ice, metal) and, for larger bodies, gravitational self-compression.
3. ***Radius*** (r):  The distance from the planemo’s center to its surface.  Technically, this is derived from the planemo’s mass and average density — but more on this in a moment.
4. ***Surface Gravity*** (g):  The strength of gravitational acceleration at the planemo’s surface — how strongly it attracts objects located one radius away from its center.
5. ***Escape Velocity*** (v): The minimum speed needed to completely escape the planemo’s gravity when starting from the surface — how much velocity is required to leave the planemo entirely.

These are all intricately interrelated in ways that are much more complicated than we need to account for here.  For instance, while **radius** _is_ derived from **mass** and **density**, it also matters how strongly the mass of the planemo is gravitationally acting on itself.  This causes ***gravitational compression***, which means that the matter is forced into a denser configuration than it would otherwise exhibit _if it were not under such intense gravitational pull_.  So, it is also true that **density** in some sense is derived from **mass** and **radius**.

Surface gravity and escape velocity are also very dependent on both mass and radius.  The farther a point on the surface of the planemo is from the planemo's center, the less gravitational attraction from the planemo it experiences, decreasing according to the ***inverse-square law*** (more on this later).  And the weaker the surface gravity, the less energy it takes to overcome it, so the lower the escape velocity.

For our purposes, it is reasonable to simplify things and say:

> Radius is an _emergent property_ of the interaction of mass and density.

... and not be too overly concerned about the subtleties.

>  **Keppy**: _Sed ego dico_, right?

Yes; this is our first official invocation of _sed ego dico_, "because I say".  No, it's not _entirely physically accurate_, but it's good enough for what we need to accomplish.

Mass and density are also dependent upon what materials the planemo is made of: most planemos are composed of several materials (rock, ice, liquid water, etc.).  Rock, itself, can composed of any number of more basic elements and compounds.

And all of these materials have their own inherent densities.  Water, for instance, has a density of about 1.0 g/cm³ (and is, in fact the _standard_ for material density in the metric system we're using.)   Iron, on the other hand, has a density of about 7.7 g/cm³  — almost eight times that of water.  So 1 kilogram of water takes up more volume than one kilogram of iron.

> There is an old riddle, which was a favorite of my maternal grandfather: "Which is heavier — a pound of iron or a pound of feathers?"  The trick to the question, of course, is that both _weigh_ a pound, but because feathers are less dense than iron, that pound (in its natural state) takes up far more volume than does the iron.



## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Establishes that **planemo masses are numerically defined** and serve only as measurements — not as categorical labels for world type.  
- Defines the **WCB symbolic mass intervals**, logarithmically divided by powers of ten relative to Earth mass (⨁).  
- Introduces symbolic naming scheme:  
  - **Below 1 ⨁:** intervals use “-i” endings (e.g., microterran, centiterran).  
  - **Above 1 ⨁:** intervals use “-o” endings (e.g., kiloterran, gigaterran).  
  - Where SI prefixes exist (e.g., kilo-, mega-), WCB adopts them directly.  
- Provides explicit table of intervals from **deniterran (10⁻¹⁰ ⨁)** through **teraterran (10¹² ⨁)**.  
- Clarifies rounding rules: each interval spans up to one demiterran (10⁻⁴ ⨁) less than the next power of ten; bodies at the threshold round upward.  
- Notes practical importance of **negative intervals** for moons, asteroids, and micro-planemos.  
- Introduces the **Microterran Scale (μt)**:  
  - A shorthand symbolic scale for masses between 10⁻⁶ ⨁ and 10⁻¹ ⨁.  
  - Improves readability and narrative clarity for small bodies (e.g., Ceres, Miranda, Vesta).  
  - Allows statements like “Ceres is 157 μt” instead of 0.000157 ⨁.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Symbolic Mass Intervals [NEW]:** deniterran, nanoterran, oktiterran, septiterran, microterran, pentiterran, demiterran, milliterran, centiterran, deciterran, terran, dekaterran, hectoterran, kiloterran, myriaterran, hexaterran, megaterran, heptoterran, octoterran, gigaterran, denoterran, ondoterran, teraterran.  
- **Microterran Scale (μt) [NEW].**  
- **⨁ (Terran mass unit) [ins].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Neither symbolic intervals nor the μ-terran scale appeared in prior canon abstracts.  
- This is the **first introduction** of a systematic symbolic framework for planemo mass measurement.  
- **Status:** [NEW] — establishes an entirely new symbolic measurement system for planemo masses.

# Principle of Mass Measurement

> **Planemo masses are purely numerically defined.**  
> They **measure** a body's physical magnitude; they do **not categorize** or **qualify** its nature or type.

The following table defines the **official WCB symbolic mass intervals** — logarithmic divisions of planemo mass based on powers of ten relative to Earth (⨁). These are used for measurement and comparison only. They are **not categorical classes**, and do **not imply world type**.

| Intervals   | Min. Mass ≥   | Max. Mass <    | Power |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| deniterran  | 0.0000000001  | 0.000000001    | 10⁻¹⁰ |
| nanoterran  | 0.000000001   | 0.00000001     | 10⁻⁹  |
| oktiterran  | 0.00000001    | 0.0000001      | 10⁻⁸  |
| septiterran | 0.0000001     | 0.000001       | 10⁻⁷  |
| microterran | 0.000001      | 0.00001        | 10⁻⁶  |
| pentiterran | 0.00001       | 0.0001         | 10⁻⁵  |
| demiterran  | 0.0001        | 0.001          | 10⁻⁴  |
| milliterran | 0.001         | 0.01           | 10⁻³  |
| centiterran | 0.01          | 0.1            | 10⁻²  |
| deciterran  | 0.1           | 1              | 10⁻¹  |
| terran      | 1             | 10             | 10⁰   |
| dekaterran  | 10            | 100            | 10¹   |
| hectoterran | 100           | 1000           | 10²   |
| kiloterran  | 1000          | 10000          | 10³   |
| myriaterran | 10000         | 100000         | 10⁴   |
| hexaterran  | 100000        | 1000000        | 10⁵   |
| megaterran  | 1000000       | 10000000       | 10⁶   |
| heptoterran | 10000000      | 100000000      | 10⁷   |
| octoterran  | 100000000     | 1000000000     | 10⁸   |
| gigaterran  | 1000000000    | 10000000000    | 10⁹   |
| denoterran  | 10000000000   | 100000000000   | 10¹⁰  |

| teraterran  | 1000000000000 | 10000000000000 | 10¹²  |
> Notes:
> 1. Where official SI prefixes exist (e.g. deci-, centi-, kilo-, mega-), WCB uses them directly.
> 2. For intermediate powers without SI prefixes, WCB adopts consistent **neologisms** based on the exponent’s magnitude:.
> 	• Exponents **below zero** use an **-i** ending (unless overridden by SI, e.g. _micro_, not _micri_).
> 	• Exponents **above zero** use an **-o** ending (unless overridden by SI, e.g. _mega_, not _mego_).
> 3. While SI defines prefixes beyond **tera-** (e.g. _peta-_, _exa-_), WCB does not typically use them in planemo contexts. Even the observable universe spans only ~46.5 **giga**lightyears (Gly) in radius — three orders of magnitude short of **teraterran** mass or volume relevance.
> 4. Conversely, the **negative intervals are symbolically essential**, as many moons, asteroids, and micro-planemos fall well below 1 ⨁ in mass. It is often more meaningful to say
> 	• “The body is **1 microterran** (μ⨁)”
> 		$\qquad$than
> 	• “The body is **0.000001 ⨁**”.
> 5. For **practical purposes**, WCB defines the upper bound of each mass interval as **one demiterran (0.00001 ⨁)** below the next power of ten.
> 	• In other words, the _terran_ interval spans from **1.0 ⨁ to 9.99999 ⨁**. 
> 	• Any value exceeding that threshold — even slightly — is considered to **round up** to the next symbolic interval.
> 		• **Example:**
> 		$\qquad$ 9.9999901 ⨁ → **10.0 ⨁**, placing the body in the **dekaterran** interval.

## The Microterran Scale
Because so many significant bodies in a planemo system have masses best expressed as a **millionth of a terran** (μ⨁), WCB defines an optional **_microterran scale_** for intuitive symbolic modeling. This scale maps cleanly to the standard symbolic intervals and absolute powers of ten.

| µ-terran Scale | Min. Mass<br>≥ µt | Max. Mass<br>< µt | *Standard<br>Scale* | *Min. Mass<br>≥* ⨁ | *Max. Mass<br><* ⨁ | *Absolute<br>Scale* |

### Interpretive Guidance
- The **μ-terran scale** improves readability and narrative clarity for small-mass bodies such as **Vesta**, **Miranda**, and **Ceres**.    
- It is especially useful for planemos with masses between **10⁻⁶ ⨁ and 10⁻¹ ⨁**, where decimal ⨁ values become visually dense or cognitively opaque.    
- This symbolic shorthand allows you to say:    
    > “Ceres is about **157 microterrans** (157 μt)”  
    > instead of  
    > “Ceres is 0.000157 ⨁”    
- However, even with this scaling, **fractional expressions remain common** at the lowest mass levels:    
    > “Miranda is approximately **0.001 μt** in mass”  
    > is still **easier to read and parse** than:  
    > “Miranda is **1 demimicroterran** in mass.”
> **In short:** The μt unit supports clarity without abandoning scalar precision — a vital aid to both symbolic modeling and thesiastic storytelling.

## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Introduces methods for **estimating the strength and extent of planetary magnetospheres** using simplified dynamo scaling laws.  
- Defines the planetary **magnetic moment (M)** as the primary parameter, derived from core radius (rc), core density (ρc), and rotation period (d).  
- Relates magnetic moment to **surface magnetic field strength (Bsurf)** through empirical scaling relations.  
- Discusses how **exponents (p, q, r)** in these formulas vary across different dynamo models (e.g., Stevenson, Driscoll & Olson).  
- Emphasizes the protective role of magnetospheres in shielding planetary atmospheres from stellar wind and cosmic radiation, with implications for long-term **habitability**.  
- Provides normalized formulas for use in worldbuilding, with Terran values as benchmarks.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **M (Magnetic Moment):** Strength of a planet’s magnetic field.  
- **Bsurf (Surface Magnetic Field Strength):** Field strength at planetary surface.  
- **rc (Core Radius):** Planetary core radius (relative to Earth).  
- **ρc (Core Density):** Planetary core density (relative to Earth).  
- **d (Day Length):** Rotation period of the planet.  
- **p, q, r:** Exponents in dynamo scaling laws.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- No duplicate abstract exists; this is the **canonical magnetosphere reference**.  
- Glossary updates required for **M, Bsurf, and dynamo scaling exponents (p, q, r)**.  
- Closely related to notes on **habitability envelopes, atmospheric retention, and stellar wind interaction**.

# Estimating Planetary Magnetospheres

- **Magnetic moment (M)** and how it relates to $B_{surf}$    
- Empirical scaling relationships (e.g., from Stevenson or Driscoll & Olson models)    
- A simplified proportional form like:

$$
B_{surf} \propto \left(\dfrac{\rho_c}{\rho_\oplus}\right)^p \times \left(\dfrac{r_c}{r_\oplus}\right)^q \times \left(\dfrac{1}{d}\right)^r
$$

   Where:
-  $r_c$ = core radius
- $\rho_c$ = core density     
- $d$ = day length (rotation period)        
- $p, q, r$ are empirical exponents from dynamo scaling studies

This is a **scaling law approximation** from planemo dynamo theory — useful, but absolutely needing context.

 🧪 **Where This Comes From (Briefly)**

This form is adapted from scaling relations used by geophysicists and planemo scientists (e.g., Olson & Christensen, Stevenson, Driscoll & Bercovici), who try to predict magnetic field strength based on **internal structure and heat flow**.

Values of $p$, $q$, and $r$ vary depending on assumptions about:
- Core thermal convection mode (thermal vs. compositional)    
- Rotational regime (rapid vs. slow)    
- Efficiency of magnetic field generation
    
 🧭 **Rule-of-Thumb Exponent Ranges**

| Exponent | Typical Value (approx.) | Notes                                                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $p$      | ⟨1.0 ∧ 1.3⟩            | Reflects that higher-density cores produce stronger magnetic energy    |
| $q$      | ⟨2.0 ∧ 2.5⟩            | Core radius has a strong effect — bigger cores mean more dynamo volume |
| $r$      | ⟨1.0 ∧ 1.5⟩            | Faster spin increases field strength, up to saturation                 |

These aren't exact, but they give a ballpark for building **comparative models** — e.g.:

> “A world with a core 1.2× Earth’s radius, 1.1× Earth’s core density, and a 16-hour day could have a magnetic field **2–3× stronger** than Earth’s, all else equal.”

Or simply provide example profiles:

- Earth: ρ = 1.0⨁, d = 24h → $B_{surf}$ ∈ ⟨25 ∧ 65> μT    
- Super-Earth: ρ = 1.3⨁, d = 16h → $B_{surf}$ ∈ ⟨80 ..120⟩ μT    
- Mars: ρ = 0.71⨁, d = 24.6h → $B_{surf}$ ≈ 0 μT (solid core)## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Extended parameters for defining geotic (human-hospitable) conditions.  
- Habitability ranges for rotation period (D), orbital eccentricity (e), orbital period (C), axial tilt (εₓ), precession cycle (χ), and obliquity azimuth (ζₙ).  
- Magnetosphere strength (Bsurf) as radiation shielding criterion.  
- Atmospheric baseline conditions: pressure, scale height, composition, ozone presence.  
- Surface balance of land and water.  
- Geotic gravity corridor (0.5–1.5 ⨁) as strict human-hospitable bound.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **D** — Rotational period (diurn length).  
- **e** — Orbital eccentricity.  
- **C** — Orbital period (sidereal chronum).  
- **εₓ** — Axial tilt (obliquity).  
- **χ** — Axial precession cycle.  
- **ζₙ** — Obliquity azimuth relative to periapsis.  
- **Bsurf** — Surface magnetic field strength (μT).  
- **Tₛ** — Average surface temperature (K).  
- **H** — Atmospheric scale height (km).  
- **g** — Surface gravity (⨁).  
- Land–sea distribution (lithosphere–hydrosphere balance).  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Reinforces prior geotic bounds with expanded atmospheric, rotational, orbital, and magnetic criteria.  
- Clarifies *why* gravity corridor (0.5–1.5 ⨁) defines Geotic worlds: outside this, planemos may be Telluric/parahabitable but not Geotic.  
- Orbital period C not freely chosen: constrained by Kepler’s Third Law, tying world design to stellar parameters.  
- Magnetosphere thresholds emphasize that both too weak and too strong fields can undermine habitability.  
- Complements and extends core Geotic definitions; functions as a reference sheet for designers setting secondary parameters.

> **Keppy**: Uh... wow.  Not sure what to make of all that, frankly.

Yes, that's a lot.

> **Keppy**: Can these be calculated for a fictional world?

Some; most not easily.  Others are completely independent of the physical parameters (and each other, come to that).  We can set some rules of thumb, as it were.

## Extended Parameter Details

**Average atmospheric composition**
- (Please see *Sideber Module – Planning A Detailed Atmosphere*)

**Rotational period/Length of diurn (D)**
- D ∈ ⟨6ʰ ∧ 120ᵈ⟩ — General Geotic Range
	- D ∈ ⟨6ʰ ∧ 48ʰ⟩ — Human-adaptable; supports familiar circadian rhythms        
    - D ∈ ⟨2ᵈ ∧ 20ᵈ⟩ — Mild extremes; thermal contrast can be buffered with atmosphere or oceans 
    - D ∈ ⟨20ᵈ ∧ 100ᵈ⟩ — Edge cases; require mitigation (dense atmosphere, global hydrosphere)     
    - D ∈ ⟨100ᵈ ∧ 120ᵈ⟩ — Rare survivable zone        
        - Habitability hinges on:            
            - Efficient heat distribution (atmosphere or oceans)                
            - Slow stellar heating (distant or cool star)                
            - Non-volatile surface conditions                
- Beyond 120ᵈ, the temperature contrast between day and night becomes too extreme for habitability **without technological aid** (which puts in the _parahabitable_ spectrum).  
	- Even a perfect ocean–atmosphere system may fail to smooth the thermal tide.  
	- Planemos in this range may be Tellurics, but they are _not_ Geotics.

> **Keppy**: Do we know what other (if any) of a planemo's physical parameters may affect its rotational period?

As a matter of fact, astrophysicists are beginning to **simulate probable spin states** for Earth-like exoplanets under different formation conditions. A few recurring themes:
- Tidal locking is expected for planemos in the habitable zones of **M-dwarfs**, due to proximity.    
- Initial rotation rates may depend on:    
    - Accretion history        
    - Giant impacts (e.g., the Moon-forming event)        
    - Early tidal evolution
- **Resonant rotations**
	- Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit resonance may be **more common than full tidal locking**
- Close-in planemos may be more likely **spin slowly or be tidally locked**
- Moons (especially those whose mass is a significant fraction of the planemo's) can stabilize or slow a planemo's rotation rate
	- This is happening with Earth; our day is lengthening by ≈ 17 microseconds per year, or 1 second every 58800 years
- Giant impacts can reset rotation direction and/or speed

**Orbital Eccentricity (e)**
- e ∈ ⟨0 ∧ 0.25⟩ — General Geotic Tolerance
- e ∈ ⟨0.01 ∧ 0.10⟩ — Earth-clone ideal range
	- In multi-planemo systems, stable configurations usually result in e < 0.10 per planemo
	- In single-planemo (only-child) or widely spaced systems, values up to e ≈ 0.25 may remain dynamically stable, but tend to reduce overall habitability
	- Risks of e > 0.25
		- Large insolation differentials between periastron and apastron
		- Pronounced climatic volatility
		- Less likelihood of maintaining **persistent, stable biospheres**
		- Increased vulnerability to **orbital perturbations**
		- Possible **transit through and out of the system's habitable zone (HZ)** during a single orbit
			- Note: On a world with zero axial tilt (ε = 0), high eccentricity might act as a surrogate for seasonal variation — producing orbit-phase-based temperature cycles.  This is *technically viable*, but requires very careful tuning of orbital shape, atmospheric thermal inertia, and surface conditions to avoid extreme or catastrophic conditions.

**Orbital Period (C)**
- This parameter **can't be freely chosen** — it's governed by **Kepler's Third Law**, originally formulated as $$P^2 \propto a^3$$and later regularized by Newton to account for the total mass of the system
- The orbital period depends on both the distance of the planemo's orbit and the _combined masses of the star(s) and planemo_.
$$C = \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M + m}}$$
where:
- C = the orbital period of the planemo in perannum
- a = the planemo's orbit's **semi-major axis** in ***Astronomical Units***
- M = the mass of the star in solar units (⊙)
- m = the mass of the planemo (also in solar units)
- In most systems, m « M and can be neglected for quick calculations:
$$C = \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M}}$$	...However, if the planemo's mass exceeds ≈ 10% of the mass of the star(s), its contribution to the period of its orbit begins to have noticeable effects.  This is especially relevant for:
		- Super-Jovian mass planemos orbiting red-dwarf stars (q.v.)
		- Binary planemo systems
			- See *Sidebar Module – Two-body Systems*
			- See also *Sidebar Module – Double-planemo or Planemo-moon*?

- I include _C_ here not because it's adjustable, but because it’s **crucial to the seasonal dynamics** of a world:   
    - It modulates how **axial tilt ($\varepsilon_x$)** and **eccentricity (e)** express over time        
    - It defines the **length of seasons**, and whether rotation (D) is **fast or slow relative to the year**  
    - It affects the **precession timescale (χ)** through long-term resonances
- In short: _IF_ you _declare C_, that choice *constrains what kind of star your system can have*.
	- See *Sidebar Module – Stars, Planetary Orbits, and Habitable Zones* for details
- *Note that the masses of other planemos in the system have no effect in this equation!*

**Obliquity (Axial tilt) ($\varepsilon_x$)**
- $\varepsilon_x$ ∈ ⟨0° ∧ 5°⟩ — Negligible seasonal variation
- $\varepsilon_x$ ∈ ⟨15° ∧ 35°⟩ — Plausible range for active seasonal variation
- $\varepsilon_x$ ∈ ⟨20° ∧ 30°⟩ — Earth-normal like
- $\varepsilon_x$ ∈ ⟨35° ∧ 45°⟩ — Extreme seasonal variation unless mitigated by atmosphere/oceans
- $\varepsilon_x$ > 45° — Potentially unstable
	- Polar and tropical regions actually reverse!

A planemo does not _have_ to have an axial tilt, but most do, because their mass isn't evenly distributed throughout their volume, and that mass is tugged on by the host star(s), companion Moons, other planemos in their star system, etc.

**Precession Cycle (χ)**
- χ ∈ ⟨15 ∧ 60⟩ ky — General Geotics range
- χ ∈ ⟨20 ∧ 30⟩ ky — Earth-clone ideal range
	- Note: If your planemo has an axial tilt ($\varepsilon_x ≠ 0$), it *will* have an axial precession period.
- < 5 ky
	- Too fast
	- Rapid climatic swings
	- Possibly preventive of long-term stable ecosystems
- 5 – 15 ky
	- Can support meaningful precession cycles
	- More frequent variation
- 20 – 30 ky
	- Earth-normal range
	- Ideal for familar Milankovitch-style climate pacing
- 30 – 60 ky
	- Acceptible
	- Modulates long-term climate, but with slower variability
- > 60 ky
	- May mute precessional influence
	- Planemo becomes dependent on *ε* or *e* (or a combination) for seasonal variation
- Habitability-Relevant Impacts of Axial Precession
	- Precession alone doesn't cause climate variation—but it _modulates_ how obliquity and eccentricity combine with seasons.
	- Precession rate is influenced by planemo tilt, mass distribution, rotation rate, and gravitational interactions (especially from moons or nearby planemos).
	- Moderately long precessional periods (25–30 kyr) help establish stable, regular Milankovitch cycles conducive to long-term ecosystem resilience. 
	- Affected by:
		- Axial tilt ($\varepsilon_x$) — higher tilts tend to precess faster.
		- Rotation rate — faster rotation yields a stronger equatorial bulge (which enhances precession).
		- Internal structure — core-to-mantle mass distribution changes the planemo’s moment of inertia.
		- Gravitational interactions — especially from moons or other planemos in the system.

**Obliquity Azimuth ($\zeta_{n}$)**
- $\zeta_{n}$ ∈ ⟨0° ∧ 359°⟩ — Measure of the _directionality_ of the planemos' obliquity relative to the periastron of its orbit.
- $\zeta_0$ is _defined_ as the orientation when the plamemo's northern hemisphere is tilted precisely away from the star or system **barycenter (ḅ)** (northern solstice) at periastron.
	- This is called ***periaptic zero***.
- $\zeta_{90}$ would indicate that northern solstice has _precessed_ 90° around the planemo's orbital path from **periaptic zero**.
- $\zeta_{180}$ would indicate that the northern solstice is occurring at _apastron_, the point in the planemo's orbit _farthest away_ from the star/barycenter.
- IMPORTANT:
	- For $\varepsilon_0$ planemos (they have no axial tilt), $\zeta_x$ is _undefined_.

**Magnetosphere (radiation shielding) ($B_{surf}$)**
- $B_{surf}$ refers to the **surface magnetic field strength**, measured in **microteslas (μT)**.    
	- For Earth, the typical surface field ranges between **25–65 μT**, depending on latitude and local crustal anomalies.
- $B_{surf} \lt 5 \mu T$ — Unshielded; high cosmic radiation exposure, especially polar regions- 
- $B_{surf} \in \langle5 \wedge 20\rangle \mu T$ — Minimal shielding; planemo parahabitable without O₃ layer and/or thick tmosphere
- $B_{surf} \in \langle20 \wedge 40\rangle \mu T$ — Weak field; still protective but slightly more porous
- $B_{surf} \in \langle40 \wedge 70\rangle \mu T$ — Comparable to Earth; effective radiation shielding
	- $B_{surf} \in \langle25 \wedge 65\rangle \mu T$ — Earth's typical magnetosphere strength range
- $B_{surf} \in \langle70, ..,100\rangle \mu T$ — Significant shielding, but with growing secondary effects
- $B_{surf} \gt 100 \mu T$ — Magnetosphere begins trapping too much radiation
	- Where the magnetosphere is concerned, there is such a thing as "too much of a good thing"; once the field strength exceeds ~100 μT, the magnetosphere may begin to trap radiation instead of deflecting it — causing the very problems it’s meant to prevent.
- $B_{surf} \gt 400 \mu T$ — Gas giant strength; radiation belts around planemo make space travel exceedingly hazardous.
- Why It Matters
	- A strong magnetic field deflects charged particles from the stellar wind, forming a **magnetosphere**.   
		- Without this protection:    
		    - **Atmospheric erosion** increases (especially from solar UV and wind)
            - **Surface radiation levels** rise, particularly in equatorial and polar regions
            - **Ozone layers** and other protective atmospheric chemistry can degrade
        - Mars is the cautionary tale: once magnetically active, its **core solidified early**, its field collapsed, and it lost most of its atmosphere to space.
- What Generates It?
	- A planemo’s magnetic field typically arises from a **dynamo effect** — the movement of **conductive fluid** (usually liquid iron) in its outer core:
	- Requires:
	    - **Electrically conductive material**
        - **Rotation** (faster helps)
        - **Active convection** in the core (driven by heat and composition gradients)
	- Influenced by:
	    - **Core size and composition** (metallicity)
	    - **Rotation rate (d)** — faster rotation generally strengthens dynamo action
	    - **Internal heat flux** — related to mass, age, and radioactive element content

# Continuation: Recommendations

We mentioned above that "... radius is the most flexible of the parameters...," and that's true, since we're treating radius as an emergent property of the other parameters, specifically mass and density.

**Gravity**, on the other hand, is really the _least_ forgiving of the parameters _for Geotic worlds_.  But that deserves a moment's attention.  We've specified that:
$$g \in \langle0.5 \wedge 1.5\rangle\oplus\text{,}$$
but we didn't really explain _why_ those are our bounds.  What _are_ the physical and biological implications of going beyond them?  Let’s look.


> **Keppy**: But some life forms _might_ still evolve on worlds like these...?

Yes, with the caveats listed above.  The point, here, though, is that while gravities outside the g ∈ ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ range are _certainly_ possible — even _probable_ — and while life _might evolve_ under these conditions, these worlds would be Tellurics in the _parahabitable_ range, outside even _habitable_, and certainly not _hospitable to humans_ which is our core criterion for **Geotic worlds**.## Abstract
**Major Topics:**  
- Five core planemo parameters: mass (m), density (ρ), surface gravity (g), escape velocity (vₑ), and radius (r).  
- Distinction between **physical properties** (m, ρ) and **emergent properties** (g, vₑ, r).  
- WCB convention: density (ρ) treated as **uncompressed density** to avoid recursive modeling.  
- Symbolic precedence hierarchy:  
  1. Mass (m), Uncompressed Density (ρ) — composition-driven.  
  2. Surface Gravity (g), Escape Velocity (vₑ) — experiential.  
  3. Radius (r) — emergent.  
- Validation: computed values for g, vₑ, and r from Geotic-range m and ρ remain within acceptable Geotic bounds.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- m = mass.  
- ρ = uncompressed density.  
- g = surface gravity.  
- vₑ = escape velocity.

# Close-focus on Parameter Precedence
Elsewhere, I stated that

> "Radius is an _emergent property — the most flexible of the five core planemo parameters*."

Here, we learn _why_ that's the case.

WCB defines five core parameters for modeling planemos:
- Mass (m)
- Density (ρ)
- Surface Gravity (g)
- Escape Velocity (vₑ)
- Radius (r)

## Physical vs Emergent Properties
The first two — **mass** and **density** — are fundamental **physical properties**. If an object is composed of a specific material (e.g., pure iron), then:
- Its **density** reflects the compactness of that material under standard conditions.    
- Its **mass** is the product of that density and volume.
These values are not “fuzzy” — they are _determined_ by composition. But there’s a complicating factor:

### Uncompressed Density in WCB
In reality, high-mass planemos **compress themselves** under their own gravity. This self-compression:
- Increases core pressure    
- Reduces actual volume    
- Nudges the average (measured) density _upward_
Unfortunately, the feedback between mass, gravity, and compression is:
- This feedback loop is **nonlinear**    
- The corrections vary by **material type**    
- And modeling it accurately requires **complex equations of state**
WCB intentionally avoids this complexity in favor of **practical worldcrafting**.

> **WCB Convention:**  
> We treat _ρ_ (density) as the **uncompressed density** of the planemo — the intrinsic density of its materials assuming no internal gravitational compression.

This keeps _ρ_ symbolically **independent** from _m_ and allows us to calculate _r_, _g_, and _vₑ_ without recursive modeling.  Compression effects are minimal within the Geotic range ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁, so this simplification is physically tolerable and worldcrafter-friendly.

### Parameter Precedence: A Symbolic Hierarchy
In WCB, we adopt a symbolic precedence system to clarify **what depends on what**.
#### First Precedence: Composition-Driven Parameters
- **Mass** (_m_)    
- **Uncompressed Density** (_ρ_)
These are **primary constraints**, based on:
- Material class    
- Planetary category    
- Biospheric plausibility    
- Narrative or symbolic intention 
#### Second Precedence: Experiential Parameters
- **Surface Gravity** (_g_)    
- **Escape Velocity** (_vₑ_)
These depend on _m_ and _ρ_, and describe how a being would **experience** the world. They answer:
- _“How heavy do things feel?”_    
- _“How hard is it to launch something into space?”_
Because they’re **experiential**, _g_ and _vₑ_ serve as **thresholds for habitability** and **filters for narrative design**.

> For writers of SF, escape velocity might be of slightly greater import, as they are often more concerned with getting characters out of the planemo's gravity well.
#### Third Precedence: Emergent Parameter
- **Radius** (_r_)
We treat radius as an **emergent quantity**, derived from the interplay between _m_ and _ρ_. Once those are specified, _r_ is computed using:
$$
\begin{align}
r &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 m}{4 \pi \rho}} &&\qquad \text{Absolute Calculation} \\
r &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{m}{\rho}} &&\qquad \text{Relative calculation}
\end{align}
$$
By defining _ρ_ as uncompressed, we sidestep recursive compression modeling and free _r_ to play its proper role as a derived result.

> **In short:** Radius is not arbitrarily assigned in WCB — it emerges from first principles, and that’s exactly what gives it flexibility.

However, if a planemo meets all other Geotic criteria but falls slightly outside the ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ radius guideline, **there is room for flex** — especially when symbolic or experiential factors support it.
### Surface Gravity, Escape Velocity, and Radius "Flexibility"
We maintain the general **Geotic envelope** of ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ for all five core parameters. However — as discussed in **Example: When Good Values Go Bad** — not all combinations of any two parameters will yield outputs that remain Geotic.

To test this, we evaluated all combinations of **mass** (_m_) and **uncompressed density** (_ρ_) within the Geotic range (⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁), using an increment of 0.05⨁ for each. From these, we calculated the corresponding:
- **Surface Gravity** (_g_)    
- **Escape Velocity** (_vₑ_)    
- **Radius** (_r_)

 #### Results from Evaluated Combinations:
- **Gravity** (_g_) — derived from _m_ and _ρ_:    
    - All values fell within the expected ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ range.        
- **Escape Velocity** (_vₑ_) — derived from _m_ and _ρ_:    
    - Calculated range was ⟨0.7071 ∧ 1.2247⟩⨁.        
- **Radius** (_r_) — derived from _m_ and _ρ_:    
    - Calculated range was ⟨0.6934 ∧ 1.4423⟩⨁.
**Conclusion:**  
All outputs for _g_, _vₑ_, and _r_ computed from Geotic-range values of _m_ and _ρ_ **remain within or closely near** the ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ constraint window.

> **Reminder:**  
> While _mass_ and _density_ serve as **primary constraints**, the values they generate for _gravity_, _escape velocity_, and _radius_ are **emergent** — and may push right up to the edges of Geotic acceptability. Planemos with marginal values on one or more of these outputs may still qualify symbolically, depending on biospheric or narrative justification.

## Order of Parameter Calculation
WCB allows you to begin with **any two** of the five core planemo parameters and calculate the remaining three. For example:
- You might specify a desired **gravity** (_g_) and **radius** (_r_) to match narrative or symbolic needs — and then calculate **mass**, **density**, and **escape velocity** from those.
However:

> ⚠️ **Caution:**  
> **Mass** (_m_) and **uncompressed density** (_ρ_) are treated as **inflexible physical constraints** in WCB. They must fall within the Geotic envelope ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ to yield plausibly habitable worlds.

### WCB Recommendation
> **Start with mass and uncompressed density.**  
> These two parameters:> 
> - Reflect the physical composition of your planemo
> - Are symbolically independent
> - Guarantee valid outputs for _g_, _vₑ_, and _r_ if kept within the Geotic range    

By anchoring your model in _m_ and _ρ_, you ensure that all derived parameters remain within acceptable bounds — streamlining your creative process and avoiding invalid combinations.
## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines a **symbolic grammar for constraints**:  
  - **Evaluative** (truth tests), **Comparative** (descriptions), **Prescriptive** (soft rules), **Mandative** (hard rules).  
- Introduces **range connectives** for closed, open, half-open, and exterior ranges (∧, ∨, ⩜, ⩝, ⊼, ⩟, ⊽, ⩡).  
- Establishes **random assignment syntax** with ⟨⟨ ⟩⟩ brackets to select values from ranges, including mandated vs. optional assignments.  
- Adds the **precision inference rule**: result precision matches the most precise endpoint.  
- Provides **axiomatic justification** (WCB Axiom 7.1 — Symbolcrafter’s Creed) for including a wide range of connectives to preserve semantic completeness.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- Constraint operators: `≤.`, `.≤`.  
- Range connectives: ∧, ∨, ⩜, ⩝, ⊼, ⩟, ⊽, ⩡.  
- Randomization operator: ⟨⟨ ⟩⟩.  
- Precision inference rule.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- **[NEW]** All notation is new [ins] — no overlaps with existing canon.  
- Serves as the **symbolic foundation** for other randomization methods (e.g., Orbit Randomization).

# Range Constraints & Random Assignment

## 🧱 Core Constraint Classes

| Type         | Symbol Form     | Meaning                         | Example                     |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Evaluative   | `x < y`, `x !≈ y`| Truth test                      | Does x satisfy a condition? |
| Comparative  | `ΔT > 0`         | Descriptive comparison          | Not used for enforcement    |
| Prescriptive | `x ≤. y`         | Should (soft rule)              | Preferred but not required  |
| Mandative    | `x .≤ y`         | Must (hard rule)                | Required for validity       |

## ✴️ Modifiers

- `!` — logical negation (`!=`, `!∈`, `!≈`)
- `.` prefix — **mandative** (`.≤`, `.∈`)
- `.` suffix — **prescriptive** (`≤.`, `∈.`)

⚠️ Do not combine `!` with dot-prefixed/suffixed forms. Use the logical inverse instead (e.g., `.>`, `>.`).

## 📏 Range Connectives

| Symbol | Meaning                  | Logical Form   | Range Type               |
| ------ | ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| ∧      | Inclusive interior       | a ≤ ▢ ≤ b      | Closed range             |
| ∨      | Exclusive interior       | a < ▢ < b      | Open range               |
| ⩜      | Inclusive exterior       | ▢ ≤ a or ▢ ≥ b | Outside, includes bounds |
| ⩝      | Exclusive exterior       | ▢ < a or ▢ > b | Strictly outside         |
| ⊼      | Left-exclusive interior  | a < ▢ ≤ b      | Half-open                |
| ⩟      | Right-exclusive interior | a ≤ ▢ < b      | Half-open                |
| ⊽      | Left-exclusive exterior  | ▢ < a or ▢ ≥ b | Edge-grazing exterior    |
| ⩡      | Right-exclusive exterior | ▢ ≤ a or ▢ > b | Edge-grazing exterior    |

## 🎲 Random Assignment Syntax

### Basic Rule:
Use `⟨⟨ ⟩⟩` to indicate **random value assignment** from a specified range.

| Expression     | Meaning                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| x = ⟨⟨a ∧ b⟩⟩  | Assign random value from a to b (inclusive)          |
| x .= ⟨⟨a ⩝ b⟩⟩ | Must assign value outside strict range               |
| x = ⟨⟨a ⩟ b⟩⟩  | Assign value in left-inclusive, right-excluded range |

- = → assignment
- .= → mandated assignment (value must be generated)

---

## 🔬 Precision Inference Rule

> The **decimal precision of a randomized result** is inferred from the **most precise** range endpoint.

| Syntax            | Result Precision |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| ⟨⟨1.4 ∧ 2.2⟩⟩     | 1 decimal place  |
| ⟨⟨1.40 ∧ 2.2⟩⟩    | 2 decimal places |
| ⟨⟨1.400 ∧ 2.200⟩⟩ | 3 decimal places |

This rule applies **even if the endpoints are excluded** from the valid output range.

---

## ❌ Invalid Forms

| Expression    | Reason                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| x = ⟨⟨1.414⟩⟩ | ❌ Invalid: one-value range          |
| x ∈ !⟨a ∧ b⟩  | ❌ Ambiguous: use `⩜` or `⩝` instead |
| x !.∈ ...     | ❌ Invalid modifier stacking         |

## 📜 Axioms

### WCB Axiom 7.1 — The Symbolcrafter’s Creed  
> *“Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.”*

All range connectives, including obscure ones like `⩡`, are retained in W101 to ensure semantic closure and support future or edge-case modeling needs.
