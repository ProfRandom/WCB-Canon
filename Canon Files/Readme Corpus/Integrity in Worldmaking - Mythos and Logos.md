## ⚖️ Integrity in Worldmaking: Mythos and Logos

Worldmaking unites two kinds of coherence:  
- **Continuity**, which governs the *story*, and  
- **Consistency**, which governs the *world.*

When either falters, immersion breaks.

A story with a perfect plot but impossible physics feels hollow; a world with flawless mechanics but forgotten motives feels sterile.  Together, continuity and consistency form the twin disciplines of **mythosic** and **logosic** integrity.

## 🧩 Plot Holes and the Continuity of Story

**Potholes** break worlds.  
**Plot holes** break stories.

A **plot hole** is a *mythosic inconsistency* — a point where the sequence or causality of a narrative fails to agree with itself.  

It’s the story-level counterpart to a *pothole*: an error not in physics or cosmology, but in the logic of events, motivations, or information.  

> **Example — The Vanishing Sword:**  
> A hero’s blade shatters in chapter seven, yet reappears unbroken in chapter nine.  
> The reader’s mind stumbles: *“Wait—didn’t that sword break?”*  
> Attention shifts from empathy (*“will she win?”*) to dissonance (*“the story forgot itself”*),  
> and the thread of belief is cut.

### Why It Matters
- Plot holes rupture **continuity**, the narrative flow that carries readers through cause, effect, and emotional development.  
- They weaken *trust* between storyteller and audience: if events do not follow, stakes lose weight and outcomes lose meaning.  
- The story ceases to be discoverable; it becomes contrived.

### Prevention
Plot holes close easily when the creator honors the same **SANC mindset** that governs WCB worldcraft:
- keep the chain of events **Sufficient and Necessary** — every action must have a reason and a result,  
- verify cause, consequence, and chronology,  
- and use **revision** the way physics uses conservation — nothing disappears without leaving a trace.

### In Short
> Continuity keeps the story straight.  
> Consistency keeps the cosmos sound.  

Together they form the dual obligations of **Worldmaking**:  
one to the *mythosic weave* of narrative,  
the other to the *logosic fabric* of the world itself.

## 🕳️ Potholes and the Integrity of Worlds

**Plot holes** break stories.  
**Potholes** break worlds.

A **pothole** is a *logosic inconsistency* — a point where a world’s physical or perceptual logic collapses under its own description.  It is the setting-level counterpart to a plot hole, occurring when the **mythosic imagination** races ahead of the **logosic framework** that should sustain it.

> **Example — The Crescent-Moon Paradox:**  
> The shadowed side of a crescent Moon is still there, faintly lit by Earthshine.  
> When art or prose shows stars shining *through* that darkness, the mind stumbles:  
> *“Wait… the Moon should block the stars.”*

In that instant, the reader’s attention shifts from awe (*“the dragon’s going to roast her!”*) to analysis (*“that can’t happen”*), breaking immersion.

### Why It Matters
- Potholes aren’t failures of imagination but of **consistency**.  
- They occur when the world forgets what it has already taught us to believe —  
- when its light, gravity, or time stop obeying their own rules.  
- Even small lapses in optical or physical logic can puncture suspension of disbelief more than grand impossibilities ever could.

### Prevention
Potholes close easily when the creator honors the **[[The SANC Principles|Second SANC Form]]**:

- Keep every model and equation only as complex as the world demands.  
- Apply the **GEWE** standard — *Good Enough for Worldmaking Efforts* — where precision adds nothing to plausibility.  
- Ensure that every description, physical or visual, remains consistent with the world’s established logic.

### In Short
> Continuity keeps the story straight.  
> Consistency keeps the cosmos sound.
