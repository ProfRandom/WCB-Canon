## 📘 **README Corpus — Entering the Canon**

### 1. The Purpose of WCB

A brief orientation: why this project exists and what problems it solves.  
Emphasize _science-adjacent empowerment_ and the unification of mythos + logos.

---

### 2. What “Worldmaking” Means

Define the triptych clearly:

|Phase|Focus|Analogue|Output|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Worldcrafting**|crafting the physical & cosmological rules|the carpenter shaping the pieces|structural coherence|
|**Worldbuilding**|constructing the cultural & narrative layer|the artisan assembling the cabinet|human texture|
|**Worldmaking**|synthesizing both into a self-consistent whole|the cabinet finished, usable, and true|verisimilitude|

Add your “logosic vs. mythosic” commentary here — it becomes the philosophical anchor.

### 3. The SANC Principle

_(Science-Adjacent, No Calculus)_  
Include the section you already wrote — it’s a perfect manifesto.  
Follow it with a short “field rule” box:

> **If it explains, it stays.  
> If it only impresses, it goes.**

---

### 4. The GEWE Corollary

_(Good Enough for Worldmaking Efforts)_  
Lighthearted but real — the builder’s permission slip.  
Maybe include a tiny vignette (“Keppy insisting on six significant figures while Hippy files them down to two”).

---

### 5. Structure of the Canon

Table of modules, one-line summaries, and how they interlock: Meta → Stars → Monons → Planemons → Orbits → Binaries → Moons.  
Emphasize that the canon reads _outward from fundamentals to phenomena._

---

### 6. How to Use This Work

Short practical guide:

- **Read conceptually**, not sequentially.
    
- **Test equations in imagination first.**
    
- **Steal responsibly:** adapt tables, rename variables, but cite the source.

### 7. Tone and Ethos

Explain the hybrid voice — halfway between observatory log and mythographer’s notebook.  
Reaffirm the aesthetic: _clarity, curiosity, compassion._

---

### 8. License and Acknowledgment

CC BY-NC-SA notice, attribution guidelines, and a short reflection on collaborative creativity.

---

### 9. Closing Epigraph

Something quietly mythic, e.g.:

> _Every equation is a kind of prayer.  
> Every world that answers, an amen._
