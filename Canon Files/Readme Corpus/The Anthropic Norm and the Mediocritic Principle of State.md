# The Anthropic Norm & the Mediocritic Principle of State

> The vast majority of matter and energy in the universe exists within a narrow, statistically dominant band of physical states —  from which it deviates only rarely and locally, within the current cosmological epoch.

This leads to two foundational insights for [[Nomenclature and Neology|worldmaking]] modeling:
1. **Rarity is not normativity.**  
    Extreme states — from black holes to degenerate matter — may be *numerous*, but they are not **norm-defining**. They are **local exceptions** to a global pattern.    
2. **Normativity is modal, not mean.**  
    The Anthropic Norm does not lie at the statistical *average*, but at the **modal cluster**:  
    the zone in which **most matter and energy exist most of the time** under current universal conditions.

Thus:
- The universe is filled with stars, but is mostly *not* plasma.  *(It was **at one time** — but that was a different epoch.)*
- Neutron stars are real, but the universe is *not* mostly neutronium.    
- Volatiles can form rocky [[Monons 1 — Framework and Equations|planemons]] — but the cosmos is *overwhelmingly* hydrogen and helium in gaseous form.
