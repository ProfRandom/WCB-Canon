# Extended Geotic Habitability Guidelines

There are other parameters that have to do with habitability:

> **Keppy**: Uh... wow.  Not sure what to make of all that, frankly.

Yes, that's a lot.

> **Keppy**: Can these be calculated for a fictional world?

Some; most not easily.  Others are completely independent of the physical parameters (and each other, come to that).  We can set some rules of thumb, as it were.

## Extended Parameter Details

**Average atmospheric composition**
- (Please see *Sideber Module – Planning A Detailed Atmosphere*)

**Rotational period/Length of diurn (D)**
- D ∈ ⟨6ʰ ∧ 120ᵈ⟩ — General Geotic Range
	- D ∈ ⟨6ʰ ∧ 48ʰ⟩ — Human-adaptable; supports familiar circadian rhythms        
    - D ∈ ⟨2ᵈ ∧ 20ᵈ⟩ — Mild extremes; thermal contrast can be buffered with atmosphere or oceans 
    - D ∈ ⟨20ᵈ ∧ 100ᵈ⟩ — Edge cases; require mitigation (dense atmosphere, global hydrosphere)     
    - D ∈ ⟨100ᵈ ∧ 120ᵈ⟩ — Rare survivable zone        
        - Habitability hinges on:            
            - Efficient heat distribution (atmosphere or oceans)                
            - Slow stellar heating (distant or cool star)                
            - Non-volatile surface conditions                
- Beyond 120ᵈ, the temperature contrast between day and night becomes too extreme for habitability **without technological aid** (which puts in the _parahabitable_ spectrum).  
	- Even a perfect ocean–atmosphere system may fail to smooth the thermal tide.  
	- Planemos in this range may be Tellurics, but they are _not_ Geotics.

> **Keppy**: Do we know what other (if any) of a planemo's physical parameters may affect its rotational period?

As a matter of fact, astrophysicists are beginning to **simulate probable spin states** for Earth-like exoplanets under different formation conditions. A few recurring themes:
- Tidal locking is expected for planemos in the habitable zones of **M-dwarfs**, due to proximity.    
- Initial rotation rates may depend on:    
    - Accretion history        
    - Giant impacts (e.g., the Moon-forming event)        
    - Early tidal evolution
- **Resonant rotations**
	- Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit resonance may be **more common than full tidal locking**
- Close-in planemos may be more likely **spin slowly or be tidally locked**
- Moons (especially those whose mass is a significant fraction of the planemo's) can stabilize or slow a planemo's rotation rate
	- This is happening with Earth; our day is lengthening by ≈ 17 microseconds per year, or 1 second every 58800 years
- Giant impacts can reset rotation direction and/or speed

**Orbital Eccentricity (e)**
- e ∈ ⟨0 ∧ 0.25⟩ — General Geotic Tolerance
- e ∈ ⟨0.01 ∧ 0.10⟩ — Earth-clone ideal range
	- In multi-planemo systems, stable configurations usually result in e < 0.10 per planemo
	- In single-planemo (only-child) or widely spaced systems, values up to e ≈ 0.25 may remain dynamically stable, but tend to reduce overall habitability
	- Risks of e > 0.25
		- Large insolation differentials between periastron and apastron
		- Pronounced climatic volatility
		- Less likelihood of maintaining **persistent, stable biospheres**
		- Increased vulnerability to **orbital perturbations**
		- Possible **transit through and out of the system's habitable zone (HZ)** during a single orbit
			- Note: On a world with zero axial tilt (ε = 0), high eccentricity might act as a surrogate for seasonal variation — producing orbit-phase-based temperature cycles.  This is *technically viable*, but requires very careful tuning of orbital shape, atmospheric thermal inertia, and surface conditions to avoid extreme or catastrophic conditions.

**Orbital Period (C)**
- This parameter **can't be freely chosen** — it's governed by **Kepler's Third Law**, originally formulated as $$P^2 \propto a^3$$and later regularized by Newton to account for the total mass of the system
- The orbital period depends on both the distance of the planemo's orbit and the _combined masses of the star(s) and planemo_.
$$C = \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M + m}}$$
where:
- C = the orbital period of the planemo in perannum
- a = the planemo's orbit's **semi-major axis** in ***Astronomical Units***
- M = the mass of the star in solar units (⊙)
- m = the mass of the planemo (also in solar units)
- In most systems, m « M and can be neglected for quick calculations:
$$C = \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M}}$$	...However, if the planemo's mass exceeds ≈ 10% of the mass of the star(s), its contribution to the period of its orbit begins to have noticeable effects.  This is especially relevant for:
		- Super-Jovian mass planemos orbiting red-dwarf stars (q.v.)
		- Binary planemo systems
			- See *Sidebar Module – Two-body Systems*
			- See also *Sidebar Module – Double-planemo or Planemo-moon*?

- I include _C_ here not because it's adjustable, but because it’s **crucial to the seasonal dynamics** of a world:   
    - It modulates how **axial tilt ($\varepsilon_x$)** and **eccentricity (e)** express over time        
    - It defines the **length of seasons**, and whether rotation (D) is **fast or slow relative to the year**  
    - It affects the **precession timescale (χ)** through long-term resonances
- In short: _IF_ you _declare C_, that choice *constrains what kind of star your system can have*.
	- See *Sidebar Module – Stars, Planetary Orbits, and Habitable Zones* for details
- *Note that the masses of other planemos in the system have no effect in this equation!*

**Obliquity (Axial tilt) (ε)**
- $\varepsilon_x$ ∈ ⟨0° ∧ 5°⟩ — Negligible seasonal variation
- $\varepsilon_x$ ∈ ⟨15° ∧ 35°⟩ — Plausible range for active seasonal variation
- $\varepsilon_x$ ∈ ⟨20° ∧ 30°⟩ — Earth-normal like
- $\varepsilon_x$ ∈ ⟨35° ∧ 45°⟩ — Extreme seasonal variation unless mitigated by atmosphere/oceans
- $\varepsilon_x$ > 45° — Potentially unstable
	- Polar and tropical regions actually reverse!

A planemo does not _have_ to have an axial tilt, but most do, because their mass isn't evenly distributed throughout their volume, and that mass is tugged on by the host star(s), companion Moons, other planemos in their star system, etc.

**Obliquity Precession Period (χ)**
- χ ∈ ⟨15 ∧ 60⟩ ky — General Geotics range
- χ ∈ ⟨20 ∧ 30⟩ ky — Earth-clone ideal range
	- Note: If your planemo has an axial tilt ($\varepsilon_x ≠ 0$), it *will* have an axial precession period.
- < 5 ky
	- Too fast
	- Rapid climatic swings
	- Possibly preventive of long-term stable ecosystems
- 5 – 15 ky
	- Can support meaningful precession cycles
	- More frequent variation
- 20 – 30 ky
	- Earth-normal range
	- Ideal for familar Milankovitch-style climate pacing
- 30 – 60 ky
	- Acceptible
	- Modulates long-term climate, but with slower variability
- > 60 ky
	- May mute precessional influence
	- Planemo becomes dependent on *ε* or *e* (or a combination) for seasonal variation
- Habitability-Relevant Impacts of Axial Precession
	- Precession alone doesn't cause climate variation—but it _modulates_ how obliquity and eccentricity combine with seasons.
	- Precession rate is influenced by planemo tilt, mass distribution, rotation rate, and gravitational interactions (especially from moons or nearby planemos).
	- Moderately long precessional periods (25–30 kyr) help establish stable, regular Milankovitch cycles conducive to long-term ecosystem resilience. 
	- Affected by:
		- Axial tilt ($\varepsilon_x$) — higher tilts tend to precess faster.
		- Rotation rate — faster rotation yields a stronger equatorial bulge (which enhances precession).
		- Internal structure — core-to-mantle mass distribution changes the planemo’s moment of inertia.
		- Gravitational interactions — especially from moons or other planemos in the system.

**Obliquity Azimuth ($\zeta_x$)**
- $\zeta_x$ ∈ ⟨0° ∧ 359°⟩ — Measure of the _directionality_ of the planemos' obliquity relative to the periastron of its orbit.
- $\zeta_0$ is _defined_ as the orientation when the plamemo's northern hemisphere is tilted precisely away from the star or system **barycenter (ḅ)** (northern solstice) at periastron.
	- This is called ***periaptic zero***.
- $\zeta_{90}$ would indicate that northern solstice has _precessed_ 90° around the planemo's orbital path from **periaptic zero**.
- $\zeta_{180}$ would indicate that the northern solstice is occurring at _apastron_, the point in the planemo's orbit _farthest away_ from the star/barycenter.
- IMPORTANT:
	- For $\varepsilon_0$ planemos (they have no axial tilt), $\zeta_x$ is _undefined_.

**Precession Phase ($\tau$)**
- This is a measure of how far along in its precessional cycle a planemo is.
- Calculated by:$$\text{$\tau$} = \left(\dfrac{\zeta_x}{360}\right)\chi$$-  IMPORTANT:
	- For $\varepsilon_0$ planemos (they have no axial tilt), ⲧ is _undefined_, as there is no obliquity to precess and no χ to measure against.
- Relationship of χ, $\zeta_x$, and ⲧ: $$
 \begin{align}
 \zeta_x &= 360\left(\dfrac{$\tau$}{\chi}\right) \\
 \chi &= \dfrac{360 \text{$\tau$}}{\zeta_x}
 \end{align}
 $$**Magnetosphere (radiation shielding) ($B_{surf}$)**
- $B_{surf}$ refers to the **surface magnetic field strength**, measured in **microteslas (μT)**.    
	- For Earth, the typical surface field ranges between **25–65 μT**, depending on latitude and local crustal anomalies.
- $B_{surf} \lt 5 \mu T$ — Unshielded; high cosmic radiation exposure, especially polar regions- 
- $B_{surf} \in \langle5 \wedge 20\rangle \mu T$ — Minimal shielding; planemo parahabitable without O₃ layer and/or thick tmosphere
- $B_{surf} \in \langle20 \wedge 40\rangle \mu T$ — Weak field; still protective but slightly more porous
- $B_{surf} \in \langle40 \wedge 70\rangle \mu T$ — Comparable to Earth; effective radiation shielding
	- $B_{surf} \in \langle25 \wedge 65\rangle \mu T$ — Earth's typical magnetosphere strength range
- $B_{surf} \in \langle70, ..,100\rangle \mu T$ — Significant shielding, but with growing secondary effects
- $B_{surf} \gt 100 \mu T$ — Magnetosphere begins trapping too much radiation
	- Where the magnetosphere is concerned, there is such a thing as "too much of a good thing"; once the field strength exceeds ~100 μT, the magnetosphere may begin to trap radiation instead of deflecting it — causing the very problems it’s meant to prevent.
- $B_{surf} \gt 400 \mu T$ — Gas giant strength; radiation belts around planemo make space travel exceedingly hazardous.
- Why It Matters
	- A strong magnetic field deflects charged particles from the stellar wind, forming a **magnetosphere**.   
		- Without this protection:    
		    - **Atmospheric erosion** increases (especially from solar UV and wind)
            - **Surface radiation levels** rise, particularly in equatorial and polar regions
            - **Ozone layers** and other protective atmospheric chemistry can degrade
        - Mars is the cautionary tale: once magnetically active, its **core solidified early**, its field collapsed, and it lost most of its atmosphere to space.
- What Generates It?
	- A planemo’s magnetic field typically arises from a **dynamo effect** — the movement of **conductive fluid** (usually liquid iron) in its outer core:
	- Requires:
	    - **Electrically conductive material**
        - **Rotation** (faster helps)
        - **Active convection** in the core (driven by heat and composition gradients)
	- Influenced by:
	    - **Core size and composition** (metallicity)
	    - **Rotation rate (d)** — faster rotation generally strengthens dynamo action
	    - **Internal heat flux** — related to mass, age, and radioactive element content

We mentioned above that "... radius is the most flexible of the parameters...," and that's true, since we're treating radius as an emergent property of the other parameters, specifically mass and density.

**Gravity**, on the other hand, is really the _least_ forgiving of the parameters _for Geotic worlds_.  But that deserves a moment's attention.  We've specified that:
$$g \in \langle0.5 \wedge 1.5\rangle\oplus\text{,}$$
but we didn't really explain _why_ those are our bounds.  What _are_ the physical and biological implications of going beyond them?  Let’s look.


> **Keppy**: But some life forms _might_ still evolve on worlds like these...?

Yes, with the caveats listed above.  The point, here, though, is that while gravities outside the g ∈ ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ range are _certainly_ possible — even _probable_ — and while life _might evolve_ under these conditions, these worlds would be Tellurics in the _parahabitable_ range, outside even _habitable_, and certainly not _hospitable to humans_ which is our core criterion for **Geotic worlds**.
