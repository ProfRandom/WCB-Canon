# Star System Thermozones
We've already introduced the term Habitable Zone before, sometimes also prosaically referred to as "The Goldilocks Zone".

> **Hippy**: Silliness!

Well....  Scientists _do_ try to keep things accessible for those not familiar with the official lingo.

Anyway, broadly speaking, this is the range of orbital distances around a given star in which an orbiting planemo might reasonably be expected to retain liquid water and a reasonably dense atmospheric envelope. In the previous section, we defined the *parahabitable*, *habitable*, and *hospitable* zones as occupying this region.

> **Keppy**: But this is based on ... what?

I'm glad you asked; it's based on how much energy (irradiance) the planemo receives from its star compared to how much insolation the Earth receives from the Sun (you may remember this concept from our discussion of the _nucleal orbit_.  And _that_ gives us our standard candle (if you'll pardon the pun).
## Naming The Zones And Labeling Their Limits

### The Thermozones
For ease of remembering these zones and their ontosomic characteristics we use the **thermozone** naming system:

| Thermozone |        Orbital Range         | <center>Ontozones</center> | Notation |                        |
| :--------- | :--------------------------: | -------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Igniozone  |     ← 0.500$\mathcal{N}$     | Inner Xenotic Zone         | $Z_{IX}$ | "Desert planemo Zone"  |
| Calorozone | ⟨0.500 ∧ 0.750⟩$\mathcal{N}$ | Inner Parahabitable Zone   | $Z_{IP}$ |                        |
| Heliozone  | ⟨0.750 ∧ 0.950⟩$\mathcal{N}$ | Inner Habitable Zone       | $Z_{IH}$ |                        |
| Solarazone | ⟨0.950 ∧ 1.385⟩$\mathcal{N}$ | Hospitable Zone            | $Z_{H}$  |                        |
| Hiberozone | ⟨1.385 ∧ 1.770⟩$\mathcal{N}$ | Outer Habitable Zone       | $Z_{OH}$ |                        |
| Brumazone  | ⟨1.770 ∧ 4.850⟩$\mathcal{N}$ | Outer Parahabitable Zone   | $Z_{OP}$ |                        |
| Cryozone   |     4.850$\mathcal{N}$ →     | Outer Xenotic Zone         | $Z_{OX}$ | "Glacier planemo Zone" |
These names are derived from:
- **Igniozone**: Latin *ignis*, "fire"
- **Calorozone**: Latin *calor*, "hot, heat"
- **Heliozone**: Greek *Helios*, an early name of the Sun god
	- Planemos in this region might be somewhat Earth-like in environment, but generally warmer\*
- **Solarazone**: Latin *solar*, from *Sol*, a title of the Sun god
	- Planemos in this region are likely to be very Earth-like in their environment\*
- **Hiberozone**: Latin *hiberno*, "cold"
- **Brumazone**: Latin *bruma*, "winter"
- **Cryozone**: Greek *kryo*, "cold"

\* Assuming they are otherwise Earth-like in size and composition.
#### Thermozone Limit Notation
For ease of reference, the limiting orbital distances of the thermozones are denoted by an *H* accompanied by a subscript:

| Notation |  Orbital Distance  |
| :------: | :----------------: |
| H₀       | 0.500$\mathcal{N}$ |
| H₁       | 0.750$\mathcal{N}$ |
| H₂       | 0.950$\mathcal{N}$ |
| H₃       | 1.385$\mathcal{N}$ |
| H₄       | 1.770$\mathcal{N}$ |
| H₅       | 4.850$\mathcal{N}$ |
Adding these to our earlier table:

| <center>Thermozone</center> | <center>Zone<br>Limits</center> | <center>Orbital<br>Range</center><br> | <center>Ontozones</center> | Notation |                       |
| --------------------------- | :-----------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: | -------------------------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| Igniozone                   |              ← H₀               |         ← 0.500$\mathcal{N}$          | Inner Xenotic Zone         | $Z_{IX}$ | "Desert planemo Zone" |
| Calorozone                  |            ⟨H₀ ∧ H₁⟩            |     ⟨0.500 ∧ 0.750⟩$\mathcal{N}$      | Inner Parahabitable Zone   | $Z_{IP}$ |                       |
| Heliozone                   |            ⟨H₁ ∧ H₂⟩            |     ⟨0.750 ∧ 0.950⟩$\mathcal{N}$      | Inner Habitable Zone       | $Z_{IH}$ |                       |
| Solarazone                  |            ⟨H₂ ∧ H₃⟩            |     ⟨0.950 ∧ 1.385⟩$\mathcal{N}$      | Hospitable Zone            | $Z_{H}$  |                       |
| Hiberozone                  |            ⟨H₃ ∧ H₄⟩            |     ⟨1.385 ∧ 1.770⟩$\mathcal{N}$      | Outer Habitable Zone       | $Z_{OH}$ |                       |
| Brumazone                   |            ⟨H₄ ∧ H₅⟩            |     ⟨1.770 ∧ 4.850⟩$\mathcal{N}$      | Outer Parahabitable Zone   | $Z_{OP}$ |                       |
| Cryozone                    |              H₅ →               |         4.850$\mathcal{N}$ →          | Outer Xenotic Zone         | $Z_{OX}$ | "Glaci planemo Zone"  |
This gives us a very robust way of discussing orbital distances in any star system.

Note that the *nucleal orbit*, being always $\mathcal{N} = 1.0N$, always falls within the Solarazone.  In fact, it always falls at 11.49% _into_ the Solarazone from its inner edge.
