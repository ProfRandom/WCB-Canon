## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines the **two fundamental orbital benchmarks** that anchor all WCB stellar-system design:  
  - **ùí© (Nucleal Orbit):** the distance at which a planemon receives the same irradiance from its star as Earth from the Sun.  
  - **ùí´ (Perannual Orbit):** the distance at which a planemon completes one Earth-length sidereal year.  
- Establishes **thermal vs. temporal** reference frameworks:  
  - ùí© ‚àù ‚àöL (luminosity-based, thermal equilibrium)  
  - ùí´ ‚àù ¬≥‚àöM (mass-based, dynamical period)  
  - Cross-relations via the mass‚Äìluminosity approximation $M ‚âà L^{1/3}$ yield   
    - $\mathcal{P} ‚âà L^{1/6}$ and $\mathcal{N} ‚âà M^{3/2}$ as usable estimators.  
- Introduces the **habitable-zone hierarchy**, proportional to ùí©:  
  - **Habitable Zone:** ‚ü®0.750 ‚àß 1.770‚ü© ùí©.  
  - **Hospitable Zone:** ‚ü®0.950 ‚àß 1.385‚ü© ùí© ‚Äî the inner, most life-friendly corridor.  
  - **Frost Line (œù):** 4.850 ùí© ‚Äî outer limit for liquid-water stability.  
- Establishes the **Ontozone notation** ($Z_{IX}$ through $Z_{OX}$) to classify orbital environments: xenotic, parahabitable, habitable, and hospitable.  
- Defines the **Thermozones** ‚Äî mnemonic names and limits for these corridors (H‚ÇÄ‚ÄìH‚ÇÖ):  
  - *Igniozone*, *Calorozone*, *Heliozone*, *Solarazone*, *Hiberozone*, *Brumazone*, *Cryozone.*  
- Demonstrates how **ùí©** and **ùí´** interlock: one defines stellar flux, the other orbital cadence. Together they form the dual coordinate system for WCB planetary design.  
- Provides practical heuristics:  
  - Use ùí© for climatic and energy modeling.  
  - Use ùí´ for calendar, resonance, and temporal modeling.  
  - Evaluate divergence (ùí´ / ùí©) to gauge whether a world‚Äôs ‚ÄúEarth-year‚Äù and ‚ÄúEarth-flux‚Äù coincide.  
- Bridges analytic astrophysics and worldbuilding application, yielding a coherent orbital nomenclature that ties thermodynamics, habitability, and chronology into a single schema.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **ùí© (Nucleal Orbit)** ‚Äî irradiance-equivalent orbital distance.  
- **ùí´ (Perannual Orbit)** ‚Äî period-equivalent orbital distance.  
- **œù (Frost Line)** ‚Äî outer liquid-water limit ‚âà 4.850 ùí©.

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Extends *Stars 0‚Äì2 (Parameters & Spectral Framework)* into orbital mechanics.  
- Establishes foundational links to *Planemons 2 (Habitability)* and *Orbits 1‚Äì3 (Dynamics & Resonance).*  
- Forms the thermal‚Äìtemporal baseline for all subsequent worldbuilding modules.


# The Nucleal Orbit
The average distance from Earth to the Sun ‚Äî about $1.496 \times 10^8$ km ‚Äî is defined as one **astronomical unit (AU)**. Due to Earth‚Äôs slightly elliptical orbit, this distance varies by approximately ¬±2.5 million km between Earth's closest approach to and farthest distance from the Sun.

So, for all practical (and thesiastic) purposes, the Earth's orbital distance (*a*) is a = 1.0AU.  In fact *a* is the commonly used symbol for _any_ orbital distance when it is expressed in Astronomical Units.

For our purposes, I have revived an old word from the dusty backroom shelves of English ‚Äî *nucleal* ‚Äî and given it new life:

> **Nucleal Orbit** ($\mathcal{N}$): the orbital distance from any given star at which a planemon receives the same stellar irradiance as Earth receives from the Sun at 1 AU.

‚Ä¶ and given it the utterly unimaginative symbol, $\mathcal{N}$.

The important thing to note here is that *$\mathcal{N}$ is not constant*, but varies from star to star, and it is calculated by:
$$
\mathcal{N} = \sqrt{L}
$$
Where:
- *L* = the Luminosity of the star in relative units

Obviously for the Sun:
$$
\mathcal{N} = \sqrt{L} = \sqrt{1} = 1
$$
> **Keppy**: So for a dimmer star N shifts closer to the star?

> **Hippy**: And for a brighter star, it shifts farther out from the star.

Correct on both counts.  And once we know _$\mathcal{N}$_, we can express the **habitable zone** (details coming!) as a proportional range around it.  For instance, for a star of half the Sun's luminosity $L = 0.5‚äô$:
$$
\mathcal{N} = \sqrt{L} = \sqrt{0.5} = 0.7071\;AU
$$
### The Nucleal Orbit and the Habitable Zone
A quick survey of the existing literature reveals a commonly held definition for the **habitable zone** as:
$$
\langle0.950 \wedge 1.385\rangle \mathcal{N}
$$
‚Ä¶ or, in other words: between 95% of the nucleal orbit distance to 1.385 times (138.5%) the nucleal orbit distance.  In the case of our hypothetical $L = 0.5‚äô$ star and its $\mathcal{N}$ nucleal orbit, the range of its habitable zone calculates to:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{N} = 0.7071\; AU \\
\text{Inner Edge} = 0.950 \mathcal{N} = (0.950)(0.7071) = 0.6717\; AU \\
\text{Outer Edge} = 1.385 \mathcal{N} = (1.385)(0.7071) = 0.9793\; AU
\end{aligned}
$$
> **Keppy**: So ... the *outer edge* of this star's habitable zone is *closer to its star* than *Earth orbits from the Sun*.....

Exactly.  But, this region is only a part of a total star system.
### The Ontozones ‚Äì Two Habitable Zones
To start with, some scientist posit a wider, more "optimistic habitable zone" region, covering:
$$
\langle0.750 \wedge 1.770\rangle \mathcal{N}
$$
For our purposes, we call this *wider spread* the actual **habitable zone** and we call the narrower span the **hospitable zone**, so that the *hospitable zone* comprises a middle lane between the extremes of the *habitable zone*:
$$
\dfrac{1.385 - 0.95}{1.77 - 0.75} = \dfrac{0.435}{1.02} = 0.4265\;AU
$$
‚Ä¶ about 42.65% of it, in fact.

| :--------------------------: | -------------------------- |
| ‚ü®0.750 ‚àß 0.950‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Habitable Zone             |

| ‚ü®1.385 ‚àß 1.770‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Habitable Zone             |

It has also been suggested that "desert" planemons (think Dune, Tattooine) might orbit in the zone between ‚ü®0.500 ‚àß 0.750‚ü©N and we might call this the "desert planemon zone", which would be, by definition, **parahabitable** to **habitable** (but mostly the former).

| ‚ü®1.385 ‚àß 1.770‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Habitable Zone             |

### The Frost Line (œù)
Research indicates that beyond a distance of about $a = 4.850\;AU$ in our Solar system, water cannot remain liquid due to insufficient irradiance from the Sun.  This distance is sometimes termed the "Frost Line" or "Ice Line", and an orbital distance of $a = 4.850N$ is the value we set for this outer limit.

For instance:
- Mars' orbit in our own Solar system is $a = 1.524\;AU$, well within the $1.770N$ limit
- The asteroid belt is ‚âà ‚ü®2.2 ‚àß 3.2‚ü©AU, beyond $1.77\mathcal{N}$, but still within the $4.850\;AU$ œù limit.  This region in our Solar system does not host a sizeable planemon (and likely never did), but if one were to exist there, it would probably be parahabitable due to the orbital distance from the Sun.

This gives us another range of orbits we can add to our accounting:

|        Orbital Range         | <center>Ontozones</center> |
| :--------------------------: | -------------------------- |
| ‚ü®0.500 ‚àß 0.750‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Parahabitable              |
| ‚ü®0.750 ‚àß 0.950‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Habitable Zone             |
| ‚ü®0.950 ‚àß 1.385‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Hospitable Zone            |
| ‚ü®1.385 ‚àß 1.770‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Habitable Zone             |
| ‚ü®1.770 ‚àß 4.850‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Parahabitable              |

Jupiter's orbit is at $a = 5.204\;AU$, well _beyond_ the $4.850\;AU$ limit, and things just get colder from there, so we can specify that if any kind of "life" does exist in this region it is likely to be extremophile by Earth standards, which WCB denotes as "***xenotic***".

|         Orbital Range         | <center>Ontozones</center> |
| :---------------------------: | -------------------------- |
| ‚ü®0.500 ‚àß 0.750‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$  | Parahabitable              |
| ‚ü®0.750 ‚àß 0.950‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$  | Habitable Zone             |
| ‚ü®0.950 ‚àß 1.385‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$  | Hospitable Zone            |
| ‚ü®1.385 ‚àß 1.770‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$  | Habitable Zone             |
| ‚ü®1.770 ‚àß 4.850‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$N | Parahabitable              |
|     4.850$\mathcal{N}$ ‚Üí      | Xenotic                    |

Similarly, any "life" that might come to be on a body orbiting closer than 0.500N would also be xenotic:

| :--------------------------: | -------------------------- |
|     ‚Üê 0.500$\mathcal{N}$     | Xenotic                    |
| ‚ü®0.500 ‚àß 0.750‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Parahabitable              |
| ‚ü®0.750 ‚àß 0.950‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Habitable Zone             |
| ‚ü®0.950 ‚àß 1.385‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Hospitable Zone            |
| ‚ü®1.385 ‚àß 1.770‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Habitable Zone             |
| ‚ü®1.770 ‚àß 4.850‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Parahabitable              |
|     4.850$\mathcal{N}$ ‚Üí     | Xenotic                    |

Finally, we differentiate between inner and outer zones, and define notations for each:

|        Orbital Range         | <center>Ontozones</center> | Notation |
| :--------------------------: | -------------------------- | -------- |
|     ‚Üê 0.500$\mathcal{N}$     | Inner Xenotic Zone         | $Z_{IX}$ |
| ‚ü®0.500 ‚àß 0.750‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Inner Parahabitable Zone   | $Z_{IP}$ |
| ‚ü®0.750 ‚àß 0.950‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Inner Habitable Zone       | $Z_{IH}$ |
| ‚ü®0.950 ‚àß 1.385‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Hospitable Zone            | $Z_{H}$  |
| ‚ü®1.385 ‚àß 1.770‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Outer Habitable Zone       | $Z_{OH}$ |
| ‚ü®1.770 ‚àß 4.850‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Outer Parahabitable Zone   | $Z_{OP}$ |
|     4.850$\mathcal{N}$ ‚Üí     | Outer Xenotic Zone         | $Z_{OX}$ |

This gives us a full inventory of orbital limits for any star system we choose to devise.


# Star System Thermozones
We've already introduced the term Habitable Zone before, sometimes also prosaically referred to as "The Goldilocks Zone".

> **Hippy**: Silliness!

Well....  Scientists _do_ try to keep things accessible for those not familiar with the official lingo.

Anyway, broadly speaking, this is the range of orbital distances around a given star in which an orbiting planemon might reasonably be expected to retain liquid water and a reasonably dense atmospheric envelope. In the previous section, we defined the *parahabitable*, *habitable*, and *hospitable* zones as occupying this region.

> **Keppy**: But this is based on ... what?

I'm glad you asked; it's based on how much energy (irradiance) the planemon receives from its star compared to how much insolation the Earth receives from the Sun (you may remember this concept from our discussion of the _nucleal orbit_.  And _that_ gives us our standard candle (if you'll pardon the pun).
## Naming The Zones And Labeling Their Limits

### The Thermozones
For ease of remembering these zones and their ontosomic characteristics we use the **thermozone** naming system:

| Thermozone |        Orbital Range         | <center>Ontozones</center> | Notation |                        |
| :--------- | :--------------------------: | -------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Igniozone  |     ‚Üê 0.500$\mathcal{N}$     | Inner Xenotic Zone         | $Z_{IX}$ | "Desert planemon Zone"  |
| Calorozone | ‚ü®0.500 ‚àß 0.750‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Inner Parahabitable Zone   | $Z_{IP}$ |                        |
| Heliozone  | ‚ü®0.750 ‚àß 0.950‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Inner Habitable Zone       | $Z_{IH}$ |                        |
| Solarazone | ‚ü®0.950 ‚àß 1.385‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Hospitable Zone            | $Z_{H}$  |                        |
| Hiberozone | ‚ü®1.385 ‚àß 1.770‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Outer Habitable Zone       | $Z_{OH}$ |                        |
| Brumazone  | ‚ü®1.770 ‚àß 4.850‚ü©$\mathcal{N}$ | Outer Parahabitable Zone   | $Z_{OP}$ |                        |
| Cryozone   |     4.850$\mathcal{N}$ ‚Üí     | Outer Xenotic Zone         | $Z_{OX}$ | "Glacier planemon Zone" |

These names are derived from:
- **Igniozone**: Latin *ignis*, "fire"
- **Calorozone**: Latin *calor*, "hot, heat"
- **Heliozone**: Greek *Helios*, an early name of the Sun god
	- planemons in this region might be somewhat Earth-like in environment, but generally warmer\*
- **Solarazone**: Latin *solar*, from *Sol*, a title of the Sun god
	- planemons in this region are likely to be very Earth-like in their environment\*
- **Hiberozone**: Latin *hiberno*, "cold"
- **Brumazone**: Latin *bruma*, "winter"
- **Cryozone**: Greek *kryo*, "cold"

\* Assuming they are otherwise Earth-like in size and composition.
#### Thermozone Limit Notation
For ease of reference, the limiting orbital distances of the thermozones are denoted by an *H* accompanied by a subscript:

| Notation |  Orbital Distance  |
| :------: | :----------------: |
| H‚ÇÄ       | 0.500$\mathcal{N}$ |
| H‚ÇÅ       | 0.750$\mathcal{N}$ |
| H‚ÇÇ       | 0.950$\mathcal{N}$ |

| H‚ÇÑ       | 1.770$\mathcal{N}$ |
| H‚ÇÖ       | 4.850$\mathcal{N}$ |

This gives us a very robust way of discussing orbital distances in any star system.

Note that the *nucleal orbit*, being always $\mathcal{N} = 1.0N$, always falls within the Solarazone.  In fact, it always falls at 11.49% _into_ the Solarazone from its inner edge.




## The Perannual Orbit
There is one remaining essential star system orbit, which I have called the **perannual** orbit.  The word comes from the Latin *per annum*, meaning "per year" or "each year", and the name reflects that this is the orbit in any star system which has an orbital period (*P*) of exactly one Earth year.
##### IMPORTANT
> "One Earth Year" in this case is the duration of Earth's complete orbit around the Sun relative to the larger reference frame of the "fixed" stars; thus this is called the **sidereal year**, from the Latin *sidus*, "star".  This is measured and denoted in terms of **ephemeris days** ‚Äî which are *defined* to be exactly 86400 _seconds_ in duration. Thus, the sidereal year (and, consequently, the perannual year) has a duration of:
$$\
\begin{aligned}
365.256363004 \quad \text{Ephemeris Days} \\
or \\
365^d\;6^h\;9^m\; 9.763545^s
\end{aligned}
$$
> This is _not_ a "year" as experienced by inhabitants on the surface of a planemon on this orbit (that is called the **tropical year**, which is in part dependent upon the _rotational period_ of the planemon, itself); this is the **sidereal year**.
> 
> Please see [[Units and Measures of Time ‚úì]] for a more in-depth discussion of this topic.

We denote the perannual year as $\mathcal{P}$, and its location in the star system _is not constant_ (the same as the *nucleal orbit* ($\mathcal{N}$) but is _determined_ by the mass of the star(s), and ‚Äì to a small but measurable degree ‚Äì by the mass of the planemon.

Please see [[M002 - Stars ‚Äî 06 Relating the Nucleal and Perannual Orbits ‚úì]] for an in-depth exploration of this relationship.

The perannual orbit is determined not by the luminosity of the star(s) in the system but by **mass**, mostly of the stars(s), but the mass of the planemon can become a calculatory relevant factor if it is a significant fraction of the mass of the star(s).

The perannual orbit is an *orbital distance*, but it is predicated on the **period** of that orbit ‚Äî how long it takes the planemon to complete one entire orbit (measured in Earth years).  **ANY** planemon orbital period is calculated (in relative terms) by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
	P &= \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M+m}} \\
	a &= \sqrt[3]{P^2 (M+m)} \\
	M + m &= \dfrac{a^3}{P^2} \qquad \text{Believe it or not, this has its uses}
\end{aligned}
$$
Where:
- *P* = the planemon's orbital period in Earth sidereal years
- *a* = the measure of the semi-major axis of the planemon's orbit
- *M* = the mass of the star(s) in Solar masses
- *m* = the mass of the planemon (also expressed in _Solar_) masses

In many cases (such as that of Earth), *m* is such a small number that it can be ignored without drastically altering the value of *P*.  In the case of Earth:

- $M = 1‚äô$
- $m = 0.000003003$‚äô ($3.003 \times 10^{-6}$) ‚Äî three *millionths* of the Sun's mass
- $a = 1\;AU$

Calculating with **only** the Sun's mass:
$$
\begin{aligned}
	P &= \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{1^3}{1}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{1}} = \sqrt{1} = 1\;\text{years}		
\end{aligned}
$$
Calculating with **both** masses:
$$
\begin{aligned}
	P &= \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M + m}} \\
	 &= \sqrt{\dfrac{1^3}{1 + 0.000003003}} \\
	 &= \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{1.000003003}} \\
	 &= \sqrt{0.999997} \\
	 P &= 0.9999985\;\text{years}		
\end{aligned}
$$
‚Ä¶ a difference of about 47.384 _seconds_.

> üîç **Takeaways**:
> >The *perannual orbit* defines the location in any star system where a planemon would complete one sidereal Earth year.
> >It may be closer-in than the nucleal orbit (**intranucleal**) or farther out than the nucleal orbit (**extranucleal**).
> >If it is ever _the same as the nucleal orbit_, then the star(s)' mass(es) must be $M = 1‚äô$, and ‚Äî ideally ‚Äî the planemon's mass must be $m = 1‚®Å$.
> >Unlike the *nucleal orbit* (which depends on *stellar irradiance*), the perannual orbit *depends only the mass of the system* ‚Äî and serves as a *temporal* rather than *thermal* reference point.

As shown above, the *distance* of any orbit can be calculated from the period and the masses via:
$$
a = \sqrt[3]{P^2 (M+m)}
$$
‚Ä¶ but if we already know that $P = 1$, it drops out of the equation:
$$
a = \sqrt[3]{M+m}
$$
‚Ä¶ such that the distance of the orbit is simply the cube-root of the sum of the masses.

For clarity, we denote the _distance_ of the perannual orbit with a $\mathcal{P}$ (for _perannual_), so our equation becomes:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{P} &= \sqrt[3]{M+m} &&\text{When taking into account both masses} \\
\mathcal{P} &= \sqrt[3]{M} &&\text{When using only the central mass} \\

We have explored both [[M002 - Stars ‚Äî 03 The Nucleal Orbit ‚úì|The Nucleal Orbit]] and [[M002 - Stars ‚Äî 05 The Perannual Orbit ‚úì|The Perannual Orbit]].  These two are not *limiting distances*, but **orbital environs** which both describe and contribute to the ontosomic nature of planemons.

As a quick review:
- **Nucleal Orbit**: that orbit (expressed in AU) at which a planemon receives from its star(s) the same radiant flux as Earth receives from the Sun at one Astronomical Unit distance, calculated by: 
 $$
	\mathcal{N} = \sqrt{L}
$$

Where *L* = Luminosity of the star(s) as expressed in Solar units, ‚äô

- **Perannual Orbit**: that orbit (expressed in AU) which has an orbital period of exactly one sidereal Earth year, calculated by:
$$
\mathcal{P} = \sqrt[3]{M+m}
$$
If we disregard the mass of the planemon *m*:
$$
\mathcal{P} = \sqrt[3]{M}
$$
And we saw in [[M002 - Stars ‚Äî 02 Parameters ‚úì]] that through relationship:
$$
M = \sqrt[3]{L}
$$
This means that:
- The perannual orbit can be *approximated* directly from the luminosity by:
$$
\mathcal{P} \approx \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{L}} \approx \sqrt[6]{L}
$$
- The nucleal orbit can be *approximated* directly from the mass by:
$$
\mathcal{N} \approx \sqrt{M^3}
$$
And, by extension either can be *approximated* from the other by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{P} &\approx \sqrt[6]{mathcal{N}^2} \approx \sqrt[3]{\mathcal{N}} \\
\mathcal{N} &\approx \mathcal{P}^3
\end{aligned}
$$
**REMEMBER**
- Both $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{P}$ are measured in astronomical units, not time!
- These last four equations are **approximations**; in most cases they'll be "accurate enough", but calculating$\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{P}$ robustly is always advised.
