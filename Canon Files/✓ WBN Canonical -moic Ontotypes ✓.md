# WBN Canonical -moic Ontotypes
_A classification of mass-based cosmic bodies by gravitational, structural, and fusion characteristics._
## 🔵 **Planemo**
> A gravitationally rounded object in the mass range typical of planemos and planemo analogs.
- **Mass Range**:  
    0.000167 ⨁ ≤ m < 4.131 kt (1.67 demiterrans to 4.131 kiloterrans)    
- **Fusion Status**: No fusion    
- **Examples**: Earth, Mercury, Ganymede, Kepler-22b    
- **Notes**: May include isolated or satellite-bound bodies; includes dwarf planemos and major moons above hydrostatic threshold.
## 🟠 **Intermo**
> A transitional-mass object between planemos and stars.
- **Mass Range**:  
    4.131 kt < m ≤ 2.664 myt (4.131 kiloterrans to 2.664 myriaterrans)
- **Fusion Status**: Sub-stellar; may fuse deuterium    
- **Examples**: Brown dwarfs, isolated non-hydrogen fusors    
- **Notes**: Symbolic “liminal” zone; fusion is partial or temporary.
## 🔴 **Stellamo**
> A self-luminous object that sustains hydrogen fusion at its core. The foundational unit of stellar systems.
- **Mass Range**:  
    2.664 myt < m ≤ 1 hxt (2.664 myriaterrans to 1 hexaterran)    
- **Fusion Status**: Core hydrogen fusion    
- **Examples**: Proxima Centauri, the Sun, Sirius A    
- **Notes**: All main-sequence stars fall here; upper bound set by radiation pressure limits (~300 ⊙).
## 🔵 **Supermo**
> A high-mass monobody object that exceeds the stellar mass range but is **not yet galactic** in scope. Includes most known neutron stars and stellar black holes.
- **Mass Range**:  
    1 hxt < m ≤ 1 Mt (100,000 ⨁ – 1,000,000 ⨁)    
- **Common Forms**:   
     - Black Holes that have exceeded stellamo mass but not yet achieved ultramo mass
## 🟣 **Ultramo**
> A **supermassive** object — typically a black hole — existing at the centers of galaxies or as relics of early cosmic formation.
- **Mass Range**:  
    1 Mt < m ≤ 1 Gt (1 million – 1 billion ⨁)    
- **Common Forms**:    
    - SMBHs        
## 🔴 **Hypermo**
> A speculative class of **hypermassive monobodies**, potentially forming during early universe conditions or beyond current observational limits.
- **Mass Range**:  
    m >1 Gt (>1 billion ⨁)    
- **Speculative Examples**:    
    - Primordial hypercollapses        
    - Direct-collapse black holes from Population III stars        
    - Core seeds of hypermassive galaxies

| Name     | Prefix | Abbr. | Mass Range (⨁)            |
| -------- | ------ | ----- | ------------------------- |
| Stellamo | —      | —     | 26,641 – 100,000          |
| Supermo  | super- | smt   | 100,000 – 1,000,000       |
| Ultramo  | ultra- | umt   | 1,000,000 – 1,000,000,000 |
| Hypermo  | hyper- | hmt   | >1,000,000,000            |

**Mirandion (ℳ)**  
The smallest symbolically significant mass unit in WBN — equal to the mass of Uranus’s moon Miranda.  
It is both a numerothesiastic threshold (0.00001 ⨁) and a mirandothesiastic sigil of **the smallest quantity that still transforms meaning**.  
The name resonates with _mirari_ — “to marvel” — anchoring the Mirandion at the boundary of the measurable and the meaningful.
