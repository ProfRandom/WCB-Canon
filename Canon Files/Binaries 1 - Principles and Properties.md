## Abstract 
**Major Topics:** 
- Defines the **fundamental geometric and mass relationships** governing all binary and barycentric systems in the WCB framework. 
- Establishes nine primary **dimensional parameters** describing the separations between the two bodies and their barycenter: 
 - **System dimensions (T‚Çò·µ¢‚Çô, ùíú, T‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì)** ‚Äî minimum, average, and maximum separations between the two bodies. 
 - **Primaron dimensions (P‚Çò·µ¢‚Çô, P‚Çê·µ•g, P‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì)** ‚Äî corresponding distances of the primaron from the barycenter. 
 - **Secondron dimensions (S‚Çò·µ¢‚Çô, S‚Çê·µ•g, S‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì)** ‚Äî distances of the secondron from the barycenter. 
- Introduces the **mass-fraction system**: 
 - **Œº = M‚ÇÇ / (M‚ÇÅ + M‚ÇÇ)** ‚Äî secondron mass fraction (defines the primaron‚Äôs barycentric orbit). 
 - **ŒΩ = M‚ÇÅ / (M‚ÇÅ + M‚ÇÇ)** ‚Äî primaron mass fraction (defines the secondron‚Äôs barycentric orbit). 
 - Demonstrates that **P‚Çê·µ•g = Œº ùíú** and **S‚Çê·µ•g = ŒΩ ùíú**, preserving Œº + ŒΩ = 1. 
- Defines the complementary **simple mass ratios** for direct comparison: 
 - **œ± = M‚ÇÇ / M‚ÇÅ** (secondron-to-primaron ratio). 
 - **œÜ = M‚ÇÅ / M‚ÇÇ** (primaron-to-secondron ratio). 
 - Relates these to the barycentric fractions through Œº = œ± / (1 + œ±) and ŒΩ = œÜ / (1 + œÜ). 
- Derives complete expressions for all nine binary dimensions as functions of ùíú, e, Œº, and ŒΩ, establishing the standard WCB notation for barycentric geometry. 
- Provides **eccentricity equivalences** for any paired parameter set and introduces the **Crux Metric (√©)** ‚Äî a measure of orbital tangency and mass asymmetry, identifying the threshold at which primaron and secondron orbits adjoin. 
- Demonstrates limiting cases (hierarchical vs. co-dominant) and applies the framework to the **Sun‚ÄìEarth** system as validation. 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **M‚ÇÅ, M‚ÇÇ** ‚Äî primaron and secondron masses. 
- **Œº, ŒΩ** ‚Äî barycentric mass fractions (secondron / primaron). 
- **œ±, œÜ** ‚Äî simple mass ratios (secondron ‚Üî primaron). 
- **ùíú** ‚Äî mean system separation (semi-major axis).

- **P‚Çç‚Ä¢‚Çé, S‚Çç‚Ä¢‚Çé, T‚Çç‚Ä¢‚Çé** ‚Äî primaron, secondron, and total orbital dimensions (min/avg/max). 
- **√© (Crux Metric):** eccentricity at which orbits become tangential. 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- Supersedes earlier drafts that duplicated barycentric expressions. 
- Aligns Œº, ŒΩ, œ±, œÜ notation with the **Stellamonic** and **duramonic** frameworks of *Meta 1 ‚Äî Principles*. 
- Provides the algebraic foundation for subsequent modules: *Binaries 2 ‚Äî Star Systems and Planemon Orbits* and *Binaries 6 ‚Äî Barycentric Geometry*. 

# The Basics
This section focuses on binary systems in general. While higher-multiplicity arrangements are common and fascinating, they introduce significant mathematical and physical complexity beyond the current scope of this guide.

Binary systems consist of two bodies bound in a mutual gravitational relationship, each tracing an orbital path around a shared center of mass known as the **barycenter** (*·∏Ö*). This point, ||shown as a black X in the figure||, *always* lies along the line connecting the centers of the two bodies and is not a massive object itself, but a calculated position determined by the masses and separation of the components.

When two monons are in a gravitational relationship, we refer to the more massive of the pair as the *primaron* and the other as the *secondron*. If the two monons are of equal mass, the distinction is purely arbitrary.

When the two objects are of unequal masses ($M_2 < M_1$), the more massive object (the primaron) orbits on an elliptical path, on average closer to the barycenter, while the **secondron** traces a *larger* elliptical path on average farther from the barycenter. Both orbits share the same eccentricity ($e$), and are synchronized in period, preserving the balance of angular momentum. They differ only in extent.

A binary system is described by a total of nine dimensions:

- $T_{min}$ , $\mathcal{A}$ , $T_{max}$ : The minimum, average, and maximum separations of the two bodies from one another
- $P_{min}$ , $P_{avg}$ , $P_{max}$: The minimum, average, and maximum separations of the primaron ($P$) from the **barycenter** (*·∏Ö*)
- $S_{min}$ , $S_{avg}$ , $S_{max}$ : The minimum, average, and maximum separations of the secondron body ($S$) from the **barycenter** (*·∏Ö*)

‚Ä¶ as well as the masses of the two bodies:
- $M_1$: the primaron mass ($P$)
- $M_2$: the secondron mass ($S$)

‚Ä¶ and the eccentricity of their orbits:
- $e$: a dimensionless value that describes the deviation of the orbital paths from perfectly circular; $e = 0$ means the orbit is a circle

These are related through a series of equations, which may seem daunting at first, but are quite straightforward once they are understood.

### Mass-fraction Equations
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
&\nu = \dfrac{M_1}{M_1 + M_2} & \text{Primaron mass-fraction} \\[1em]
&\mu = \dfrac{M_2}{M_1 + M_2} & \text{Secondron mass-fraction}
\end{array}
$$

### Primaron Dimensions
$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{avg} &= \mathcal{A} \times\dfrac{M_2}{M_1+M_2} = \mu\,\mathcal{A} \qquad &&\text{Primaron average distance}\\[1em]
P_{min} &= P_{avg}(1 - e) \qquad &&\text{Primaron minimum distance} \\[1em]
P_{max} &= P_{avg}(1 + e) \qquad &&\text{Primaron maximum distance} 
\end{aligned}
$$
### Secondron Dimensions
$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{avg} &= \mathcal{A} \times\dfrac{M_1}{M_1+M_2} = \nu\,\mathcal{A} \qquad &&\text{Secondron average distance}\\[1em]
S_{min} &= S_{avg}(1 - e) \qquad &&\text{Secondron minimum distance} \\[1em]
S_{max} &= S_{avg}(1 + e) \qquad &&\text{Secondron maximum distance}
\end{aligned}
$$
### Total (Overall) Dimensions
$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{min} = \mathcal{A}(1 - e)
= P_{min} + S_{min} = T_{max}\left(\dfrac{1 - e}{1 + e}\right) \\
T_{max} = \mathcal{A}(1 + e)
= P_{max} + S_{max} = T_{min}\left(\dfrac{1 + e}{1 - e}\right) \\
\mathcal{A} = \dfrac{T_{min}}{1 - e}
= \dfrac{T_{max}}{1 + e}
= P_{avg} + S_{avg}\\[0.5em]
\end{aligned}
$$
### Eccentricity Relationships
In the equations below a subscript dot $X_\bullet$ means any two matching parameters ; e.g. $Max_{\bullet} - Min_{\bullet}$ means any maximum value minus any minimum value of the same parameter, such as $P_{max} - P_{min}$.

#### System Eccentricity
$$
\begin{aligned}
e &= \dfrac{Max_\bullet - Min_{\bullet}}{Max_\bullet + Min_{\bullet}}
\;\;=\;\; \left[1 - \dfrac{Min_{\bullet}}{Avg_{\bullet}}\right]
\;\;=\;\; \left[\dfrac{Max_{\bullet}}{Avg_{\bullet}} - 1\right] \\[1em]
&= \left(P_{max} \times \dfrac{M_1 + M_2}{\mathcal{A} \times M_2}\right) - 1
\quad = \quad 1 - \left(P_{min} \times \dfrac{M_1 + M_2}{\mathcal{A} \times M_2}\right) \\[1em]
&= \left(S_{max} \times \dfrac{M_1 + M_2}{\mathcal{A} \times M_1}\right) - 1
\quad = \quad 1 - \left(S_{min} \times \dfrac{M_1 + M_2}{\mathcal{A} \times M_1}\right) \\[1em]
\end{aligned}
$$
#### The Crux Metric ($\acute{e}$)
The circle $X_{\circ}$ subscript is used to indicate expressions in which all terms share the **same positional magnitude** (e.g., max, min, or average), regardless of parameter type.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\acute{e} = \dfrac{M_1 - M_2}{M_1 + M_2}
= \dfrac{|S_{\circ} - P_{\circ}|}{S_{\circ} + P_{\circ}} 
= \dfrac{|S_{\circ} - P_{\circ}|}{T_{\circ}}
\end{aligned}
$$
- $√©$ (e-prime) is the system eccentricity value at which the orbits of the stars become ***adjoined tangential*** $(e > 0; M_1 \neq M_2)$
- For a mass ratio of $^{M_2}/_{M_1} = 0.8$, the system requires $\acute{e} ‚â• 0.8519$ for the primaron and secondron orbits to adjoin tangentially (see below).

# Relative Orbit of the Secondron
There are times (such as when the secondron is less massive than the primaron ‚Äî typically $^{M_1}/_{M_2} \gtrsim 80$, the approximate star/brown dwarf mass dividing line, but it works for sub-stellamon bodies as well ‚Äî it is convenient to treat the primaron as stationary and the secondron as following the relative orbit alone. Therefore,

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{min} = T_{min} \\[0.5em]
R_{avg} = \mathcal{A} \\[0.5em]
R_{max} = T_{max} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
For instance, in the case of the Earth-Sun system:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{A} &= 1.0 AU \\[0.5em]
P_{avg} &= \mu\,\mathcal{A} \\[1em]
&= 1.0 \times \frac{1}{333000+1} \\[1em]
&= 1.0 \times \frac{1}{333001} = 3.009299 \times 10^{-6} AU \\[1.5em]
1 \text{ AU } &= 1.496 \times 10^6 \text{ km} \\
\therefore P_{avg} &= 3.009299 \times 10^{-6} \times 1.496 \times 10^8 ‚âà 449 \text{ km} 
\end{aligned}
$$

Considering that the Sun‚Äôs radius is $696{,}340$ km, a wobble of only $‚âà 450$ km ($\approx 0.065\%$) is justifiably negligible, so the math works out well enough by just treating the Sun as stationary and the Earth as orbiting it.

# Constant Equalities
Some relationships between the masses of the primaron and secondron and their related orbital separations are constant:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\varrho = \dfrac{M_2}{M_1} = \dfrac{P_\circ}{S_\circ} &\text{Secondron mass-ratio} \\[1em]
\varphi = \dfrac{M_1}{M_2} = \dfrac{S_\circ}{P_\circ} &\text{primaron mass-ratio} 
\end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\mu = \frac{P_\circ}{T_\circ} = \frac{M_2}{M_1 + M_2} \qquad
&&\nu = \frac{S_\circ}{T_\circ} = \frac{M_1}{M_1 + M_2} \\[1em]
&\frac{T_\circ}{S_\circ} = \frac{M_2}{M_1} + 1 = \varrho + 1 \qquad
&&\frac{T_\circ}{P_\circ} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} + 1 = \varphi + 1 \\[3em]
&\frac{Min_\bullet}{Max_\bullet} = \frac{1 - e}{1 + e} \qquad
&&\frac{Max_\bullet}{Min_\bullet} = \frac{1 + e}{1 - e}
\end{aligned}
$$

Again, if the mass of the secondron ($M_2$) is expressed in terms of the mass of the primaron ($M_1$), the equations become:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{S_\circ}{P_\circ} = \frac{1}{\varrho} = \varphi \qquad
&&\frac{P_\circ}{S_\circ} = \varrho = \frac{1}{\varphi} \\[1em]
&\frac{P_\circ}{T_\circ} = \frac{\varrho}{\varrho + 1} \qquad
&&\frac{S_\circ}{T_\circ} = \frac{1}{\varrho + 1} \\[1em]
&\frac{T_\circ}{P_\circ} = \frac{1}{\varrho} + 1 \qquad
&&\frac{T_\circ}{S_\circ} = \varrho + 1
\end{aligned}
$$

## Stellamon Mass Pairings
Solar analog stars are more often than not found in binary or multiple systems than not, with over half exhibiting multiplicity.

- **Duquennoy & Mayor (1991)** originally found that approximately **57%** of solar-type stars (spectral types F6-K3 ‚Äî more-or-less what WCB calls **Solar Cognates**) in the solar neighborhood are part of binary or higher-order systems.
- **Raghavan et al. (2010)** updated this with modern data for the same spectral class range, reporting:
 - **~44%** as binaries
 - **~11%** as triples or higher
 - ‚Üí Yielding a total multiplicity fraction of **~55%** for solar-type stars. 

This tendency toward multiplicity defines a pattern that profoundly influences system architecture, orbital stability zones, and the landscape of potential habitability.

### Companion Mass Trends by Primaron Type

From the combined statistical analyses of **Duquennoy & Mayor (1991)**, **Raghavan et al. (2010)**, **Moe & Di Stefano (2017)**, and **Li et al. (2022, LAMOST)**, a clear pattern of Primaron-to-Secondron spectral type pairings emerges: the **spectral class of the primaron star** strongly constrains the **range of companion masses** likely to occur. In other words, binary pairing is *not* random across the mass spectrum.

- **Early-type primaries (A‚ÄìF)** tend to draw secondrons from a **narrow, high-mass corridor**, favoring near-equal companions‚Äîwhat observers call the *twin excess*. 
- **Solar-type primaries (G-class)** exhibit a **broader, moderately declining distribution**, allowing both near-equal companions and somewhat smaller partners (typically late G or K types). 
- **Cooler primaries (K‚ÄìM)** show a **progressively wider, low-mass-biased spread**, where secondrons are often much smaller‚Äîlate K, M, or even substellar companions.

This trend can be summarized as:

> Earlier, hotter stars ‚Üí **narrow, high-q pairing range** (favoring twins). 
> Later, cooler stars ‚Üí **broad, low-q range** (favoring lighter companions).

Calculating a secondron star's mass ($M_2$) based on the mass of the primaron ($M_1$):

$$
M_2 = M_1 \times ‚ü®‚ü®a ‚àß b‚ü©‚ü©^{k}
$$
Where:
- $M_1$ ‚Äî primaron mass 
- $M_2$ ‚Äî secondron mass (assigned) 
- $‚ü®‚ü®a ‚àß b‚ü©‚ü©$ ‚Äî random draw between *a* and *b* (inclusive range) 
- $k$ ‚Äî ***optional* weighting exponent**, biasing toward the lower or upper bound 
- $k = 1$: uniform distribution 
- $0 < k < 1$: bias toward lower-mass companions 
- $k > 1$: bias toward higher-mass (twin-like) companions

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|l}
\textbf{Primaron} &
\textbf{Range } \langle a \wedge b \rangle &
\textbf{Lower-bias (smaller } M_2\text{)} &
\textbf{Upper-bias (twin } M_2\text{)} &

A & \langle 0.9 \wedge 1.0 \rangle & \langle 0.8 \wedge 0.9 \rangle & \langle 1.2 \wedge 1.5 \rangle &

F & \langle 0.7 \wedge 0.9 \rangle & \langle 0.6 \wedge 0.8 \rangle & \langle 1.1 \wedge 1.3 \rangle &
\text{Slight bias toward smaller companions, but twins still possible.}\\[0.6ex]
G & \langle 0.6 \wedge 0.8 \rangle & \langle 0.5 \wedge 0.8 \rangle & \langle 1.0 \wedge 1.2 \rangle &

\end{array}
$$
**How to read this table**
- The ‚Äúlower-bias‚Äù column gives a reasonable p range if you want your generator to prefer small companions.
- The ‚Äúupper-bias‚Äù column gives values that push draws upward (more ‚Äútwin-like‚Äù systems).
- The ‚Äútypical neutral value‚Äù is the mid-case consistent with observed distributions.

#### Limiting Eccentricity ($\bar{e}$)
For close-binaries, the two stars should never approach closer than $T_{min} = 0.10$ AU (ideally $0.15$ AU). The eccentricity of the system which forces this limit can be calculated by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{e} = \dfrac{T_{max} - 0.100}{T_{max} + 0.100}
\end{aligned}
$$
- $ƒì$ (e-bar) is the largest system eccentricity that can be used with a given $T_{max}$ , while ensuring that $T_{min} ‚â• 0.100$.

If you know what eccentricity you want the system to have and need to figure out the minimum maximum separation $T_{max}$ that will maintain $T_{min} ‚â• 0.100$ AU, you can calculate it by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{max} ‚â• 0.100\left(\dfrac{1 + \bar{e}}{1 - \bar{e}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
### The Period‚ÄìEccentricity Relation

#### 1. **Observed Pattern**

Empirically, binary systems trace a clear trend:

| Regime | Typical Period P | Typical Eccentricity e | Behavior |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Short-period** | P ‚â≤ 10 days | e ‚âà 0 | Nearly circular |
| **Intermediate** | 10 ‚Äì 10¬≥ days | e rises from 0 ‚Üí 0.6 | Mixed circular / elliptical |
| **Wide** | P ‚â≥ 10¬≥ | Broad scatter, e often 0.6‚Äì0.9 | Dynamically ‚Äúhot‚Äù |
This relation has been confirmed repeatedly‚Äîfrom **Duquennoy & Mayor (1991)** and **Raghavan et al. (2010)** to **Moe & Di Stefano (2017)** and modern **Gaia DR3** samples.

This relation has been confirmed repeatedly‚Äîfrom *Duquennoy & Mayor (1991)* and *Raghavan et al. (2010)* to *Moe & Di Stefano (2017)* and modern *Gaia DR3* samples.

#### 2. **Physical Cause ‚Äî Tidal Circularization**

Close binaries experience **tidal friction**: each star raises bulges on its companion. 
Friction within those bulges converts orbital energy into heat, draining the system‚Äôs eccentricity.

Circularization timescale roughly scales as

$$
t_{circ} \propto \left(\frac{\mathcal{a}}{R}\right)^8 \propto P^{\frac{16}{3}}
$$

 ‚Äî so even a modest change in separation produces a huge difference in damping time. 
Systems that are young and close become circular long before wide pairs even notice tides.

#### 3. **Residual Eccentricities and Anomalies**
- **‚ÄúTwin‚Äù binaries** (nearly equal-mass, short-period) are most circularized.
- **Eccentric short-period outliers** often show evidence of a **third companion** pumping *e* through Kozai‚ÄìLidov cycles.
- **Post-mass-transfer pairs** can re-acquire modest eccentricity as mass loss changes the potential.

#### 4. **Approximate Empirical Envelope**

For solar-type primaries, the upper bound of observed eccentricities can be sketched as

$$
e_{max} \simeq 1 - \left(\frac{P_{circ}}{P}\right)^\frac{2}{3}
$$
with $P_{circ} \sim 10$ days days for main-sequence systems in the solar neighborhood. 

Beyond $P \approx 1000$ days, the envelope flattens near $e_{max} \approx 0.9$.
