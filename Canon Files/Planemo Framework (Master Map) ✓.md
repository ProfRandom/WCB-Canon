# 🌍 Planemo Framework (Master Map)

All **Planemos** (planetary monobodies) share a **common trunk** — then branch into two complementary classification systems.

---
## 🌳 Trunk (Shared Levels)

- **Frame** → Monobody    
- **Group** → Planemo   

---
## 🪨 Conformation Branch (Structural / Physical)
Focus: **What the planemo is made of**
- **Order** → Composition families    
    - Lithic (rock/metal)        
    - Astatic (mixed/volatile)        
    - Aetheric (gaseous)        
    - Ulsic (exotic/degenerate)
        
- **Form** → Subdivisions of each order    
    - Lithic → Petriform, Carboform        
    - Astatic → Pagoform, Fluxiform        
    - Aetheric → Transiform, Pneumoform, Haliform        
    - Ulsic → Neutraform, Quarkform, etc.

## 🌱 Ontosomic Branch (Life-Relevance / Biospheric)
Focus: **How the planemo relates to life (esp. Earthlike envelopes)**
- **Class** → Broad livability envelopes    
    - Geotic (Earth-normal range)        
    - Gaean (Earth-twin slice of Geotic)        
    - Rheatic (super-Earths with biospheric richness)        
    - Xenotic (exotic chemistries / non-carbonic)
        
- **Type** → Subdivisions of classes    
    - Marginal Geotic, Dense Hot Rheatic, etc.

- **State (Climostates)** → Global climatic conditions    
    - Cryostate (frozen)        
    - Hydrostate (temperate hydrosphere)        
    - Pyrostate (runaway greenhouse)        
    - Pluristate (diverse climates)        
    - etc.
        
- **Condition** → Finer descriptors of atmospheric/seasonal character    
    - Tempestal (storm-dominated)        
    - Zephyral (mild winds, gentle climate)        
    - Serenal (stable, calm, serene environment)

## 🧭 Principle
- **Conformation** = _physical chemistry_ of the body.    
- **Ontosomy** = _life-relevance_ of the body.    
- Both are **valid, independent lenses** for describing the same planemo.
    
- Example:    
    - Earth = Lithic (Order) → Petriform (Form)        
    - Earth = Geotic (Class) → Gaean (Type) → Pluristate (State) → Serenal (Condition)
