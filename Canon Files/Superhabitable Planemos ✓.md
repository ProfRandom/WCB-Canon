# Superhabitable Planemos

**Definition**  
The concept of *superhabitable planemos* was proposed by René Heller and John Armstrong (2014) to describe worlds with physical, orbital, and stellar characteristics that make them **more conducive to rich, diverse biospheres** than Earth — though not necessarily more suitable for humanoid or Earthlike life.

**Stellar Criteria**  
- Host star mass range: ⟨0.359 ∧ 0.817⟩⊙ (spectral classes M0 – G9)
	- [[Spectral Class Base Table ✓]]
- Host star lifespan: ⟨1.656 ∧ 12.934⟩⊙ years  
- Stellar age: Older than the Sun’s 4.5 Ga but younger than 7 Ga

**Planemo Characteristics**  
- **Mass**: ⟨2.0 ∧ 3.0⟩⨁ (optimum ≈ 2.0⨁)  
- **Radius**: ⟨1.260 ∧ 1.442⟩⨁ (maintains Earthlike density and gravity)  
- **Geology**: Larger tectonic–volcanic cycling, longer plate tectonic activity, strong carbon–silicate cycle, thicker atmosphere retention.  
- **Magnetic Field**: Stronger due to larger liquid core and higher internal heat.  
- **Surface Geography**: Flatter topography, shallower oceans, widely distributed ocean coverage (~71% surface area) without large continuous land masses.  
- **Temperature**: Mean ≈ 25 °C (77 °F).  
- **Atmosphere**: Thicker than Earth’s; O₂ concentration > 20.95%.  
- **Orbit**: Closer to the center of the host system’s habitable zone than Earth is in the Solar System.  
  - Solar System example: center of optimistic HZ ≈ 1.26 AU; center of conservative HZ ≈ 1.16 AU.

**Scientific Rationale**  
From Heller & Armstrong (2014):  
> “Terrestrial planemos that are slightly more massive than Earth, up to 2 or 3 M⊕, are preferably superhabitable due to the longer tectonic activity, a carbon–silicate cycle active on a longer timescale, enhanced magnetic shielding, larger surface area, smoother surface, thicker atmosphere, and the positive effects of non-intelligent life on habitability.”

Lena Noack & Doris Breuer (2011) add:  
> “…the propensity of plate tectonics seems to have a peak between 1 and 5 Earth masses… a geological perspective suggests the optimal mass of a planemo is about 2 M⊕.”

**Relation to WBN Classifications**  
In *Worlds by the Numbers*, **Rheatic Planemos** encompass the superhabitable concept, with parameter refinements for internal consistency within WBN’s classification system.
