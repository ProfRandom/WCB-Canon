> _Xenotics_ are planemos whose environmental conditions may support **non-Earthlike life**, including **non-carbonic**, **non-water-based**, or otherwise exotic biochemistries. The term is not tied to physical parameters, but to the **biological strangeness** of the world's potential life-hosting capacity.

**Core Feature**:
- Xenotic classification **is not about what the world _is_** — it’s about **what kind of life it might support**.    
- A Xenotic world might be a rocky, icy, or gaseous body — but its **biotic potential lies outside** the realm of Earth-normal life.
- This is an _extremely_ broad classification: only 0.35% of planemos sharing Xenotic mass and density ranges qualify as _Tellurics_.  Gaeans share mass and density range with only 0.001% of Xenotics.
**Key Principle**:
> A world may fall entirely within Gaean or Geotic **parameters** and still be **Xenotic in character** — if its biosphere is chemically or structurally **alien to terrestrial assumptions**.

**Inclusions**:
- **Ammonia-based** or **methanogenic** biospheres (e.g., Titan-like)    
- **Silicon-based** or **plasma phase** consciousness (hypothetical)    
- **High-pressure deep-atmosphere lifeforms** on gas giants    
- **Ultra-dense crust-worlds** with lattice-bonded metabolic substrates    
- **Life emerging in conditions unreplicable on Earth**
**Exclusions**:
- Gaean or Geotic worlds are **not Xenotic** simply by shape or size.    
- Xenotic worlds **may physically overlap** with all other categories — but their **life potential diverges completely**.
**Symbolic Use**:
- From Greek _xenos_ (ξένος): “stranger,” “foreigner,” “outsider.”    
- Xenotic worlds are those where **life is not just different — it is alien**.
**Parameter Notes**:
- **Mass (⨁):** from sublunar pebbles to brown dwarf threshold.    
- **Density (⨁):** from hydrogen-ice slushes to ultra dense crystal-metallic cores.    
- **Gravity (⨁):** ~0.02⨁ (Mars-like) up to ~60⨁ (felt at inner gas dwarf surfaces). 
	- Spans everything from fragile ultralow-gravity cometary clumps to neutronium-crusted compact objects just short of degeneracy collapse.
	- This definition also accommodates highly stratified gas layers (e.g. floatable biospheres in Saturnian-class or puffy hot-Neptune exotics).
	- Any values beyond this envelope cross into **ulsic** or **hypotheticals**: black holes, quark matter, etc.
- **Radius (⨁):** up to 11⨁ to accommodate inflation-limited gas giants and Super-Jupiters.
	- Frequently exceeded by puffy planemos due to close proximity to their stars inflating their atmospheres.
- **Escape Velocity (⨁):** capped at 25⨁ ≈ 280 km/s, brushing the domain of hot-start brown dwarfs.

> These are **not bound by Earth-normal biology**. They simply represent physically plausible, self-cohering planemo-scale entities where exotic life — as chemistry permits — might arise.
