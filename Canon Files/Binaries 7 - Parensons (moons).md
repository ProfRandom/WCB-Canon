# Regular and Irregular
WCB retains the traditional astronomical distinction between **regular** and **irregular** moons (see below), while refining it through genealogical terms that clarify their origins: **primogenic** (formed alongside their primaron) and **syllipsic** (captured after formation).

**Regular** moons are described by the following characteristics:
- Orbit fairly close to the primaron
- Tend to have *prograde* orbits (they orbit in the same direction as the primaron's axial rotation)
	- With little-to-no inclination, and
	- Small eccentricities
- Are *primogenic*: they formed alongside their primaron

**Irregular** moons, in contrast, are described by the characteristics:
- Follow distant orbits
- Often have *retrograde* orbits (they orbit in the opposite direction from the primaron's rotation)
	- With high inclinations, and
	- High eccentricity
- Are *syllipsic*: they were captured by their primaron after forming elsewhere.

There are, of course, exceptions. Uranus’s moon **Triton** exhibits characteristics of both classes:  
- It orbits close to Uranus on a nearly circular path — traits of a *regular* moon.  
- Yet its orbit is **retrograde** and **highly inclined**, hallmarks of an *irregular* moon.

These contradictions imply that Triton is **syllipsic** in origin: a captured **midimon** (dwarf-planemon) whose orbit was later circularized by tidal evolution.

# Major and Minor
Traditionally, “major moons” are those that have achieved **hydrostatic equilibrium**—they are **spheric**, their shapes maintained primarily by gravity. “Minor moons,” in contrast, are **nodulic**: held together more by the tensile strength of their materials than by self-gravity.

These terms arose from **observational happenstance** rather than physical taxonomy. Larger, spherical moons were easier to detect with early telescopes and thus labeled “major.” The smaller, non-spherical, nodulose bodies were discovered later and labeled “minor.”

Historically, therefore, moons have been described within a **two-axis matrix**: *regular / irregular* vs. *major / minor.*

Examples include:  
- **Triton** — a *major–irregular* moon.  
- **Luna** — a *major–regular* moon.  
- **Phobos** and **Deimos** — *minor–irregular* moons.

The **Worldmaking Canon** deprecates *major* and *minor* as taxonomic labels. They imply **hierarchy** or **importance**, whereas in practice, they are only **observational artifacts**. A moon’s orbital configuration is the more meaningful attribute; its overall shape is an *emergent property* of its mass, density, and radius.

Accordingly, the Canon replaces “major” and “minor” with the intrinsic descriptors:  
- **spheric** — stable under self-gravity (hydrostatic equilibrium), and  
- **nodulic** — mechanically cohesive rather than gravitationally bound.

Thus:  
- **Triton** → *spheric, irregular parenson*  
- **Luna** → *spheric, regular parenson*  
- **Phobos** and **Deimos** → *nodulic, regular parensons*, being nonspherical yet orbiting close to Mars on low-inclination, nearly circular paths.
	
## Phobos and Deimos
Phobos and Deimos illustrate a point of divergence between the **Worldmaking Canon** and traditional astronomical nomenclature. Historically, both were classed as *minor–irregular* moons: small, nonspherical, and presumed to be **captured asteroids**.

Later analysis made that interpretation untenable.  Phobos, in particular, is too fragile to have survived an external capture; tidal stresses would have pulverized it before orbital stabilization.  
Current models indicate that both **Phobos** and **Deimos** are instead **retentive derivatives** of a vast **impact event** roughly **four billion years** ago, when a **Ceres–Vesta–mass** object collided with **Mars**.  The debris remained within Mars’s Hill sphere, briefly forming a transient ring system from which the present moons later accreted.

In Worldmaking Canon taxonomy, Phobos and Deimos are therefore **consequent, nodulic, regular parensons**—mechanically cohesive bodies in near-circular, low-inclination orbits that formed *as a result of* local events within their primaron’s domain.  They are *neither primogenic nor syllipsic*, but **consequent**, born of the Mars system’s own debris rather than imported from beyond it.
