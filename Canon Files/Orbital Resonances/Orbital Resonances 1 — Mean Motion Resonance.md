# Mean Motion Resonance

When two bodies orbit a third body in common, there will be resonances in their orbits. If one body’s orbit is an exact integer value different from the other’s, the two are said to be in *mean motion resonance*, and the ratio of their orbits is **a : b**, denoted as the longer orbital period followed by the shorter orbital period, separated by a colon (∶).

For example, in the figure above, Body 1 orbits twice for every one orbit of Body 2.  This is a _first order resonanc_, because the difference between the two values is only 1 unit:
$$
2 - 1 = 1
$$
Other examples of first-order resonances[^1] would be 6 : 5, 13 : 12, etc.

Examples of a _second-order resonance_ would be those in which the orbital periods were separated by a difference of 2; e.g. 3 : 1 or 5 : 3.  The higher the order of the resonance, the less stable the orbits will be over time.

Mean motion resonances can arise between three or more bodies.  Jupiter's moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede experience a 4 : 2 : 1 mean motion resonance between them, such that for every orbit Ganymede makes, Europa completes two, and Io completes four.  This also means that Io orbits twice per each orbit of Europa.

However, an interesting phenomenon also occurs, such that Ganymede, Europa, and Io _never line up_ on the same side of Jupiter.  Any two of them may line up at various points in their orbital dance, but all three never do.

> While N-conjunctions are _technically_ possible in N-orbiton systems, they are reliant on very specific conditions of orbital eccentricity and coplanarity; mean motion resonances between more than three objects should be treated for all intents and purposes as _impossible_.
