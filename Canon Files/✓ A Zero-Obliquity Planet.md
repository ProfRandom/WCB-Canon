## Abstract
**Major Topics:**  
- Characteristics of a zero-obliquity (ε ≈ 0°) planet.  
- Climatic consequences: absence of seasons, uniform day length.  
- Astronomical consequences: no annual change in stellar altitude or apparent size.  
- Cultural/calendar implications: limited concept of “year,” reliance on lunar or stellar cycles.  
- Alternative mechanisms for “seasons” via high orbital eccentricity.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- ε = obliquity (axial tilt).  
- e = orbital eccentricity.  
- Periastron / Apastron distances (Rₘᵢₙ, Rₘₐₓ).  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Relates to glossary terms: obliquity (ε), eccentricity (e), periastron/apastron.  
- Complements **Orbital Eccentricity and Seasonal Effects.md** by exploring a special case.  
- Conceptual overlap with habitability/seasonality discussions in climate-related notes.

# A Zero-Obliquity Planet
## Basics
A planet with no axial tilt (or a very, very modest one — anything <2.5°)


- If eccentricity is low (e < 0.10), no major seasonal variation through the year.
- All days are the same length, everywhere, all year long.
- "Seasonal" constellations still occur, because the direction the "night side" of the planemo faces still changes as it orbits.
- No change in the size of the star in the sky during orbit.
- From a stellar standpoint, the concept of a "year" would be meaningless
	- ONLY changes like the slow rotation of the night sky from night to night, or the period of a major moon would be available for calendrical development.

### Alternative Methods Of Generating "Seasons"
#### Zero Obliquity With High Orbital Eccentricity
A planet with zero obliquity might experience something akin to seasons if it were on a highly elliptical orbit that carried it particularly close to and distant from the star at either periastron or apastron, or both.

Eccentricities in excess of 0.40 — which is _highly_ eccentric (Mercury's orbital eccentricity is 0.2056).

Depending on the configuration of the orbit, the planet might:
- Pass very close to the star at periastron
- Linger extremely distant from the star at apastron
- Experience both extremes on each orbit.

Orbital period would come into play, here, as well.  If the orbit is short in duration, these fluctuations might be experienced more as something like seasonal changes, whereas if the orbit is of long duration, they might be more climatological shifts over a span of years, or even centuries or millennia.

In the case of high orbital eccentricity, the apparent size of the star in the sky might become naked-eye noticeable.
