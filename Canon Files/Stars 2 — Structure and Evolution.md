## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Introduces the concept of **stellar populations**, a classification system based on **metallicity** (abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium).  
- Three recognized populations:  
  - **Population I:** high metallicity, young stars (e.g., the Sun).  
  - **Population II:** low metallicity, older stars.  
  - **Population III:** zero metallicity, primordial stars (early universe, hydrogen + helium only).  
- Notes that the numbering is counterintuitive (‚Äúbackward‚Äù): Population I = most recent, Population III = oldest.  
- Provides an alternate framing in terms of **stellar generations**, which reverses the numbering for intuitive clarity:  
  - **Generation III = Population I** (high metallicity).  
  - **Generation II = Population II** (low metallicity).  
  - **Generation I = Population III** (zero metallicity).  
- Discusses future outlook:  
  - No ‚ÄúGeneration IV‚Äù expected, since ongoing star formation continues to produce Population I stars with similar compositions.  
  - Supernovae and stellar recycling do not significantly change overall metallicity ratios in the cosmos.  
  - Long-term: star formation will decline, leaving remnants (neutron stars, quark stars, black holes) in a steady state.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**

- **Stellar Generation I, II, III [NEW/neo].**  
- **Metallicity [sci].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Stellar populations (I‚ÄìIII) are introduced here for the first time in canon.  
- **Generational reinterpretation [neo]** is unique to WCB, offering a more intuitive framing.  
- **Metallicity [sci]** is established science, formally abstracted here for the first time.

# Stellar Populations
Another way stars are sometimes classed is by stellar population; somewhat confusingly, these are also designated by Roman numerals, but in this case the number indicates the ***metallicity*** of the star.

> **Keppy**: Metallicity?!?!

Yep; for astronomers, any element that's not hydrogen or helium is a "metal" ‚Äî apparently astronomers and chemists don't talk to each other.

| Population     | Description      |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Population I   | High Metallicity |
| Population II  | Low Metallicity  |
| Population III | Zero Metallicity |
The stellar population number can be taken as a _rough_ estimate of a star's age, but here is where the system is confusing, because the population number are "backward".  Population I stars are high metallicity stars like the Sun, and are the most recent "generation" of stars.  Population III stars (if any actually still exist) are almost totally lacking in metals, and are the first stars to have formed in the early universe when hydrogen and helium were the only raw material on offer.

An alternative way of thinking about stellar populations might be as "generations", numbered in reverse sequence to populations:

| Generation     | Population     | Description      |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Generation III | Population I   | High Metallicity |
| Generation II  | Population II  | Low Metallicity  |
| Generation 1   | Population III | Zero Metallicity |
## Stars: The Next Generation

>Keppy: So, will there be a Generation IV?

Probably not ‚Äî and here's why: 
- While there is certainly still star-forming going on in the universe (the Orion Nebula, for instance), the stars forming there are still Population I/Generation III stars.
- The gasses and heavier elements that are going into their composition aren't changing in relative proportions over time.
- Supper massive stars _are_ still producing heavy elements, and novae and supernovae are still distributing those elements into the cosmos, the overall amounts of such heavy elements is not increasing, and heavy elements are not being produced at a faster rate than in the past.

Newly formed stars, then don't have basic compositions in any fundamental way different from the previous generation.

>In fact, if the "heat death" model of the universe is correct, star formation will _decrease_ with time, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes will eventually replace self-luminous fusors, and everything will settle into a "steady state" that will persist for eternity.## Abstract

# Stellar Lifetimes and System Habitability


Margaret Turnbull and Jill Tartar* have listed some criteria that stars would need to have in order to be what they call a ‚Äúhabstar‚Äù ‚Äî one likely to have an Earth-like planet orbiting it. Among their criteria, they list that the star should:
1. Be on the Main Sequence;
2. Be non-variable;
3. Have a habitable zone;
4. ***Be at least 3 billion years of age***.

This last criterion is critical (for our purposes perhaps the most important), because it automatically disqualifies any star which has a main sequence lifetime of $Q < 3.0$ Ga.  This means that a ‚Äúhabitable star‚Äù needs to have a current age of *no less* than 65% that of the Sun, and a total Main Sequence lifetime of *at leas*t 30% that of the Sun ($3.0$ Ga; $0.300$‚äô).

## Identifying A Maximum Spectral Class

For a star with $Q = 3.0‚äô$, using our Main Sequence Stellar Equations of State:

![[Main Sequence Stellar Equations of State ‚úì]]

We can approximate a relative temperature of:
$$
T = Q^{-0.2} = 0.3^{-0.2} = 1.272‚äô
$$
‚Ä¶ which is a Kelvin temperature of:
$$
K = 5800T \approx 7379
$$
Consulting our [[Stellar Thermal Interval Constant Table ‚úì]]
![[Stellar Thermal Interval Constant Table ‚úì]]

‚Ä¶ we see that this Kelvin temperature falls into the F-Class range, which has a TIC of $√æ = 150$.

Applying our Spectral Class calculation from Kelvin temperature:
$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S} &= \dfrac{\kappa - K}{√æ} \\ \\
 &= \dfrac{7500 - 7379}{150} \\ \\
 &= \dfrac{121}{150} \\ \\
\mathcal{S} &= 0.807 \\ \\
\end{align}
$$So, no Main Sequence star above spectral type F0.81 will have _total Main Sequence lifetime_ long enough to qualify as "habitable".

Since we have specified (in [[M002 - Stars ‚Äî 08 `Sun-Like` Stars]]) that the spectral type range for stars with perannual orbits within the parahabitable zone (see [[M002 - Stars ‚Äî 04 Thermozone Orbits]]), and since F2 is "later" on the spectral class continuum than F0.81, we know that all stars defined as "solar analogs" have lifetimes long enough to be "habitable" system hosts.
#### Relating Stellar Ages to Appearance and Evolution of Life

The earliest fossils of complex multicellular life appear about **600 million years ago**, and the earliest fossils widely accepted as animals are from the phylum _Cnidaria_‚Ä† ‚Äî marine species that show up in the record around **580 million years ago** during the late Ediacaran, just before the Cambrian Explosion. Taking the accepted age of the Earth as **4.56 billion years**, this means Earth was about **4.0 billion years old** (~88% of its present age) before complex life began to appear.

If we assume a similar pace of biological development for complex life on other Earth-like exoplanets, then any star with a main sequence lifetime of **‚â§ 3.0 billion years** would leave its habitable planets without enough time for complex life to evolve indigenously ‚Äî ending its stable phase at least a billion years too soon. (This does not preclude such worlds from supporting transplanted or migratory complex life.)

On the other hand, the **Great Oxygenation Event**‚Ä° ‚Äî which shifted Earth‚Äôs atmosphere from one dominated by carbon dioxide and methane to one with persistent oxygen levels above ~15% ‚Äî occurred around **2.4 billion years ago**, when Earth was roughly **2.16 billion years old** (~47% of its current age). The gap between that oxygenation and the first appearance of complex animals was thus about **1.8 billion years**. This suggests that, in principle, complex life _could_ arise at any time after oxygenation, but on Earth the delay was geologically long.

For our purposes, we can specify that an Earth-analog planet must be at least **~2.0 billion years old** to have plausibly developed an aerobic atmosphere by biological means, and at least **~4.0 billion years old** to have produced indigenous complex life. The **minimum** planetary age for being (in)habitable to human colonists is therefore the lesser of these: **~2.0 billion years**.

A star with a main sequence lifetime of **3.0 billion years** could host an Earth-analog planet that had time to produce an oxygenated atmosphere, and then remain stable for roughly another **1 billion years** before leaving the main sequence. Such a system could be colonized by humans or other oxygen-breathing life, even if indigenous complexity had not yet evolved. The next step is to determine which spectral classes meet this **‚â• 3 Ga** lifetime criterion.

As with all stars (even the most stable and long-lived) the Sun's luminosity has varied over its lifetime. Shortly after its formation, its luminosity was about $70\%$[^1] of its current value, and the luminosity has experienced an average increase of about $6.7\%$ per billion years to its present value. When the Sun was 1 billion years old, its luminosity was about $76.7$% of its current value of $3.828 \times 10^{26}$ W. Thus the habitable zone limits and the nucleal orbit of a star, all of which are *dependent upon its luminosity*, will also be different depending on its age, and vary as the star ages.

For instance, the habitable zones for the Sun on its billion-year birthday were:
$$
\begin{align}
H_0 = 0.500\sqrt{0.767} = 0.438 \\
H_1 = 0.750\sqrt{0.767} = 0.6578 \\
H_2 = 0.950\sqrt{0.767} = 0.832 \\
N = \sqrt{0.767} = 0.876 \\
H_3 = 1.385\sqrt{0.767} = 1.213 \\
H_4 = 1.770\sqrt{0.767} = 1.550 \\
H_5 = 4.850\sqrt{0.767} = 4.248 \\
\end{align}
$$
Compare these numbers with the semi-major axes of the Solar terrestrial planets: at that time, Venus was 0.066 AU within the optimistic habitable zone (it‚Äôs $0.027$ AU outside now) and Mars was within the optimistic habitable zone by $0.026$ AU. (Neither was within the conservative habitable zone.) The Earth was $0.124$ AU beyond the nucleal orbit at that time.

| Planet  | Orbit |
| ------- | ----- |
| Mercury | 0.387 |
| Venus   | 0.723 |
| Earth   | 1.000 |
| Mars    | 1.524 |
Thus, while Venus is demonstrably uninhabitable now, it is possible (perhaps likely) that it was a far more habitable planet 3.0 billion years in the past (especially if its rotational period were more-or-less what it is now) as is discussed in a Scientific American article by Shannon Hall from August 2016 titled ‚ÄúHellish Venus Might Have Been Habitable for Billions of Years‚Äù.[^2]

## The Sun's Future 'Habitable Zones'
The Sun's luminosity will *increase* as it ages, pushing the habitable zone limits outward from where they are now. Because the rate at which the Sun uses up its hydrogen fuel increases as its temperature increases, its luminosity will grow by an average of $18.42$ per billion years going forward.

So, in about $600$ ka, the luminosity of the Sun will have increased enough that it will begin to have deleterious effects on Earth: CO‚ÇÇ levels in the atmosphere will begin to drop, negatively impacting Earth‚Äôs flora. By 1 billion years from now, all complex Earthly life will be gone: the loss of plants will lead to the loss of herbivores, and consequently the carnivores which feed on them. Shortly after this time, Earth‚Äôs water will begin to evaporate wholesale, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect which will eventually bake away any and all remaining microbial life, as well.[^3]

By around 5.5 billion years from now (when the Sun is about 10 billion years old and nearing the end of its Main Sequence lifetime) the Sun's luminosity will have increased to about $2.02$ times its current value, yielding the following figures for the habitable zone limits and the nucleal orbit at that time:
$$
\begin{align}
H_0 = 0.500\sqrt{2.02} = 0.711 \\
H_1 = 0.750\sqrt{2.02} = 1.066 \\
H_2 = 0.950\sqrt{2.02} = 1.350 \\
N = \sqrt{2.02} = 1.421 \\
H_3 = 1.385\sqrt{2.02} = 1.947 \\
H_4 = 1.770\sqrt{2.02} = 2.516 \\
H_5 = 4.850\sqrt{2.02} = 6.893 \\
\end{align}
$$
So, by that time, Venus may very well be mostly molten, Earth will be desiccated and sterilized,  Mars will be just $0.103$ AU beyond the new nucleal orbit, and Jupiter (at $5.204$ AU), will be within the outer boundary of the parahabitable zone.

Thereafter, the Sun will enter its red giant phase and its luminosity will shoot up dramatically, as will its diameter, utterly engulfing Mercury and rendering Venus and Earth into hellish, lifeless balls of mostly molten rock.[^4]

## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Explores calculation of habitable zones (thermozones) around **giant and supergiant stars**.  
- Notes that HZ limits depend on **luminosity**, but actual distances must be measured from the **stellar surface** ‚Äî giant radii become a critical factor.  
- Worked example: **Aldebaran (K5 III)** with R = 44.2 ‚äô, L = 439 ‚äô, M = 1.16 ‚äô ‚Üí nucleal orbit N ‚âà 20.95 AU with orbital period ‚âà 89 yr.  
- Discusses why main-sequence scaling laws fail for evolved stars (incorrect masses from radius‚Äìmass or luminosity‚Äìmass relations).  
- Extends to theoretical **200 M‚äô stars** (upper stellar mass limit), comparing MS scaling vs. the **Eddington limit**.  
- Worked example: **Stephenson 2-18**, largest known star (R ‚âà 2150 ‚äô, L ‚âà 440,000 ‚äô, M ‚âà 45 ‚äô) ‚Üí nucleal orbit ‚âà 663 AU.  
- Concludes that while thermozones can be calculated, giant/supergiant systems are **not Terran-hospitable**: their short lifetimes, unstable envelopes, and huge radii preclude long-term habitability.

# 'Habitable Zones' of Giant Stars
Remember that although the habitable zone limits are *calculated* using the luminosity of the star, they are *measured* in distance from its center of mass. Thus, a giant star like Aldebaran, with a radius of $44.2$‚äô and a luminosity of $439$‚äô, will have much larger fundamental orbits than the Sun.

## Stellar Radius Becomes a Significant Factor
Aldebaran's radius is the Sun's radius of $695,700$ km $\times 44.2 = 30,749,940$ km. One astronomical unit is $149.6$ million kilometers, which means that Aldebaran's radius measures $0.206$ astronomical units.

Thus, were Aldebaran to replace the Sun in the Solar system, its surface would fall only about $0.387 ‚Äì 0.206 = 0.181$ AU (‚âà $27$ million km) inside Mercury's orbit.

>Aldebaran‚Äôs true mass is measured at $1.16‚ÄâM‚äô$‚Äã. If, however, we incorrectly applied the main-sequence radius‚Äìmass scaling, we‚Äôd get $M \approx 67.34‚äô$\‚Äã; the main-sequence luminosity‚Äìmass scaling would give $M \approx 4.959‚äô$‚Äã. Both are wildly wrong ‚Äî illustrating why Main Sequence relations must only be applied to Main Sequence stars; using them on evolved stars like Aldebaran gives wildly misleading results.

Using Aldebaran's correct (measured) mass value, its perannual orbit falls at $\mathcal{P} =\sqrt[3]{1.16} = 1.051$ AU, which is only $0.845$ AU beyond the star‚Äôs surface.

Aldebaran‚Äôs habitable zone limits and nucleal orbit calculate to be:
$$
\begin{align}
H_0 = 0.500\sqrt{439} = 10.476 \\
H_1 = 0.750\sqrt{439} = 15.714 \\
H_2 = 0.950\sqrt{439} = 19.905 \\
N = \sqrt{439} = 20.952 \\
H_3 = 1.385\sqrt{439} = 29.019 \\
H_4 = 1.770\sqrt{439} = 37.086 \\
H_5 = 4.850\sqrt{439} = 101.619 \\
\end{align}
$$
The orbital period of the nucleal orbit is:
$$
\mathcal{N}_p = \sqrt{\dfrac{20.952^3}{1.16}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{9197.94}{1.16}} = \sqrt{7929} = 89.05 \text{ years}
$$
‚Ä¶ or about $54\%$ of Neptune's orbital period.

### Extending Into The Supergiant Realm
The theoretical maximum mass for a star is 200 M‚äô.  We can't use the standard $L=M^{3.8}$ equation for stars above about 20 M‚äô, so we have to choose the _lesser_ between:
$$
\begin{align}
L &= k \times M^{1.5}\;, \text{where } k=1.12 \times10^3 \\[1em]
&\text{or} \\
L_{Edd} &= 3.2 \times 10^4 \left(\dfrac{M_*}{M_‚äô}\right)L‚äô \quad \text{(The Eddington Limit)} 
\end{align}
$$
In our case the equations return:
$$
\begin{align}
L_{MS} &= 1.12 \times 10^3 \times (200^{1.5}) = 1.12 \times 10^3 \times (2.828 \times 10^3) = 3.168 \times 10^6 \\[1em]
&\text{and} \\
L_{Edd} &= 3.2 \times 10^4 \left(\dfrac{200}{1}\right)L‚äô = 6.4 \times 10^6
\end{align}
$$
‚Ä¶ so we'd go with the $L_{MS}$ value, and calculate the thermozone limits by:
$$
\begin{align}
H_0 &= 0.500\sqrt{3.168 \times 10^6} = 889.94 \\
H_1 &= 0.750\sqrt{3.168 \times 10^6} = 1334.92 \\
H_2 &= 0.950\sqrt{3.168 \times 10^6} = 1690.89 \\
N &= \sqrt{3.168 \times 10^6} = 1779.89 \\
H_3 &= 1.385\sqrt{3.168 \times 10^6} = 2465.14 \\
H_4 &= 1.770\sqrt{3.168 \times 10^6} = 3150.40 \\
H_5 &= 4.850\sqrt{3.168 \times 10^6} = 8632.46 \quad \text{(almost 14\% of a lightyear)} \\
\end{align}
$$
‚Ä¶ but a perannual orbit of only
$$
\mathcal{P} = \sqrt[3]{M} = \sqrt[3]{200} = 5.848\;\text{AU}
$$
‚Ä¶ which is **18.152 AU _inside_** the minimum estimated 24 AU radius of such a star.

### Working With a Known Star
The largest known star currently is Stephenson 2-18, with a radius of $R = 2150‚äô\;(9.999AU)$, a measured luminosity of $L = 440000‚äô$, and an upper estimated mass value of $M = 45‚äô$.  These values yield thermozone limits of:
$$
\begin{align}
H_0 &= 0.500\sqrt{440000} = 331.66 \\
H_1 &= 0.750\sqrt{440000} = 497.49 \\
H_2 &= 0.950\sqrt{440000} = 630.16 \\
N &= \sqrt{440000} = 663.32 \\
H_3 &= 1.385\sqrt{440000} = 918.71 \\
H_4 &= 1.770\sqrt{440000} = 1174.09 \\
H_5 &= 4.850\sqrt{440000} = 3217.13 \\
\end{align}
$$
‚Ä¶ and a perannual orbit of:
$$
\mathcal{P} = \sqrt[3]{M} = \sqrt[3]{45} = 3.557\;\text{AU}
$$
‚Ä¶ 6.442 AU _inside_ the radius of the star.

## Conclusion
You _can_ calculate thermozones (and hence orbital architectures) for giant and supergiant stars, but their immense radii, unstable envelopes, and short lifespans mean those thermozones don‚Äôt correspond to genuinely _habitable real estate._ In Protagorean terms, they fail the human-centered test: such systems are not _Terran-hospitable_, though they may be _mathematically parahabitable_ ‚Äîthat is, capable of hosting planets that humans could _use_ (for energy, staging, or resource acquisition) without being worlds where Terran-like life would be expected to evolve. (Of course, whether truly alien **xenotics** might arise under such extreme conditions is another matter entirely.)
## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Critiques the **traditional stellar spectral sequence** (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) as inconsistent, non-linear, and historically accreted rather than systematically designed.  
- Highlights specific discontinuities (e.g., **F9 ‚Üí G0 only ~150 K**, while **F0 ‚Üí F9 spans ~1350 K**) to show irregular subclass gaps.  
- Explains how the **Worldmaking framework (WCB)** resolves these issues by adopting a **linearized spectral system**:  
  - Each class is assigned a clean, evenly divided temperature range.  
  - Subclasses interpolate predictably across the scale.  
  - Enables symbolic clarity, ease of computation, and consistency with habitability modeling.  
- Distinguishes use cases:  
  - Use **traditional astrophysical data** when realism is desired.  
  - Use the **lin Add notWCBwhy WCB uses neologisms (septi-, okti-, etc.)                                                                                                        ale (WCB):** evenly spaced subclasses across temperature ranges.  
- **Thermozones:** orbital/temperature relationships tied to stellar classification.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Complements *M002 ‚Äî Stars: 01WCBectral Classes* (which already introduces the linearized scale).  
- This note serves as a **sidebar critique and justification** for adopting the WCB linearized system.  
- No new glossary terms or symbols required; all terms already established in existing canon.

# Mind the Gap ‚Äì The Shortcomings of the Traditional Spectral Scale

The classWCBl stellar spectral sequence ‚Äî O, B, A, F, G, K, M ‚Äî originated as a cataloging system based on observed absorption lines in starlight. It was never designed to be linear, complete, or even particularly rational. And it shows.

> üîç _Spectral types weren‚Äôt designed ‚Äî they accreted._

- Early classifiers like **Annie Jump Cannon** grouped stars by hydrogen line strength.
    
- Later work (e.g., by Morgan, Keenan, and Payne-Gaposchkin) retrofitted those types to surface temperature.
    
- The result? **Inconsistent temperature spans**, irregular gaps between classes, and no underlying mathematical symmetry.
    

### üå°Ô∏è Consider the G‚ÄìF Discontinuity:

- **F9 ‚Üí G0**: Drop of only ~150 K
    
- **F0 ‚Üí F9**: Nearly 1350 K
    
- Linear? Not even close.

## üß≠ Why WCB Fixes This

Worldbuilder‚Äôs Notebook (WCB) adopts a **linearized spectral system**:

- Each speWCBal class is assigned a clean temperature range
    
- Subclasses divide that WCBge evenly
    
- The system becomes **interpolatable**, **predictable**, and **symbolically clear**
    

This makes it easier to:

- Calculate stellar parameters from temperature
    
- Relate stars to their orbits and Thermozones
    
- Avoid the awkwardness of stars that fall ‚Äúbetween classes‚Äù
    

> ‚öñÔ∏è _The WCB scale isn‚Äôt astrophysically perfect ‚Äî but it‚Äôs symbolically powerful, and consistently usable._
