## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **Geotic planemos** as **habitable** terrestrial-class worlds (rocky–metallic composition) where humans can survive with minimal adaptation.  
- Establishes parameter corridors wider than Gaeans but still viable for Earth-based life:  
  - Mass (m): 0.30–3.35 ⨁  
  - Density (ρ): 0.85–1.25 ⨁  
  - Surface Gravity (g): 0.60–1.65 ⨁  
  - Radius (r): 0.60–1.50 ⨁  
  - Escape Velocity (vₑ): 0.65–1.50 ⨁  
- Emphasizes that density is tightly bounded to ensure terrestrial composition, while mass and radius are more flexible.  
- Geotics may require **atmospheric processing, infrastructure, or selective siting**, but can still yield shirtsleeve environments.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Geotic** — Habitable terrestrial-class planemo.  
- **m, ρ, g, r, vₑ** — Fundamental planemo parameters (Earth-relative).  
- **Marginal Earth-twins** — Near the edge of Gaean ranges.  
- **Super-Earths (high-gravity Geotics)** — Heavier but still habitable.  
- **Cooler, lighter Earthlikes** — Lower-pressure, lower-gravity variants.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- All **Gaeans** are Geotics, but not all Geotics are Gaeans.  
- Broader corridors allow for habitability beyond strict shirtsleeve optimum.  
- Complements **Gaean** and **Gravity One Corridor** entries by defining the wider viable zone.

$$\text{GEOTIC} := \left\{ (m, \rho) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ \middle|\

> _Geotics_ are **habitable** planemos — terrestrial-class worlds where humans can survive and thrive with minimal adaptation. These planemos fall within a broader Earth-like envelope, allowing a wider range of environmental and structural conditions than Gaeans, while remaining physically and biologically viable for Earth-based life. Atmospheric processing, infrastructure, or selective location may be required, but **shirtsleeve environments** are still plausible.

**Core Feature**:
- _Density bounds_ are kept narrow to ensure terrestrial composition (i.e., rocky–metallic silicate structure), but mass and radius are permitted greater variation, producing a range of surface gravities and escape velocities still compatible with Earth-based life — particularly plants, microbes, and well-supported human habitation.   
**Implication**:
- Geotics may include:    
    - **Marginal Earth-twins** (on the edges of Gaean parameters)        
    - **High-gravity super-Earths** (with greater landmass and thicker atmospheres)        
    - **Cooler, lighter Earthlikes** (with lower pressure and gravity, but survivable biospheres)
**Geotic ≠ Gaean**:
- All **Gaean** worlds are a _subset_ of Geotics.    
- But Geotics may include conditions beyond optimal comfort — requiring adaptation or technology to sustain human colonization.
