## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **Telluric Planemos** as solid- or semi-solid-surfaced worlds across a wide mass range, regardless of habitability.  
- Parameter ranges (relative to Earth units ⨁):  
  - **Mass (m):** ⟨0.01 ∧ 10.00⟩  
  - **Density (ρ):** ⟨0.50 ∧ 7.00⟩  
  - **Surface gravity (g):** ⟨0.15 ∧ 8.00⟩  
  - **Radius (r):** ⟨0.15 ∧ 3.00⟩  
  - **Escape velocity (vₑ):** ⟨0.20 ∧ 3.00⟩  
- Encompasses rocky, metallic, and icy planemos: Earthlike planets, super-Earths, sub-Earths, Mars, Titan, Ganymede, Io, Kepler-20b, etc.  
- **Core role in canon:**  
  - All **Geotic**, **Gaean**, and **Rheatic** planemos are subsets of Tellurics.  
  - ~4.8% of Tellurics are Geotics; ~0.55% are Gaeans; ~3.6% are Rheatics.  
- Many Tellurics are **parahabitable**: survivable only with life support, domes, or partial terraforming.  
- Symbolic note: term derives from *Tellus* (Earth-mother), but used **structurally, not biologically**.  

**Relations to Other Types:**  
- Overlaps with **Xenotic** planemos in rocky mass range.  
- Differentiation: **Telluric = structural (rocky/icy/metallic)** vs. **Xenotic = exotic composition**.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **Telluric [NEW].**  
- **Geotic [neo], Gaean [neo], Rheatic [neo], Xenotic [neo], Parahabitable [neo]** (already canonical, here reinforced).  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Introduces **Telluric** as a new umbrella category.  
- Integrates existing WCB planemo types (Geotic, Gaean, Rheatic, Xenotic, Parahabitable) under this umbrella.  
- **Status:** [NEW + EXPANDED] — Telluric is newly defined; expands canon by clarifying relationships among existing planemo classes.

# Telluric Planemos

## Telluric
**Telluric** := ⟨ m ∧ ρ ∧ g ∧ r ∧ vₑ ⟩  
	m := ⟨0.01 ∧ 10.00⟩⨁  
	ρ := ⟨0.50 ∧ 7.00⟩⨁  
	g := ⟨0.15 ∧ 8.00⟩⨁ 
	r := ⟨0.15 ∧ 3.00⟩⨁
	vₑ := ⟨0.20 ∧ 3.00⟩⨁

> Tellurics are parahabitable worlds with solid or semi-solid surfaces — encompassing the full class of rocky, metallic, and icy planemos.  
> This category includes Earthlike worlds, massive rocky exoplanets, marginal sub-Earths, and bodies like Mars, Ganymede, Titan, or large moons of gas giants.  
> It defines the geophysical domain of terrestrial planemos — whether habitable or not — and serves as the primary envelope from which Geotic, Gaean, and Rheatic worlds are derived.

**Core Feature**  
- This is a broad categorization — about **4.8%** of Tellurics are Geotics, and only about **0.55%** of all Tellurics are Gaeans — and **3.6%** of Tellurics are Rheatics.  
- These worlds possess defined solid surfaces or lithospheres, with no requirement for biological habitability.  
- Many are parahabitable — survivable with life-support systems, domes, or partial terraforming.  
- May include frozen dwarfs, massive dry worlds, or oceanic with no dry land.
**Relations to Other Types**  
- Contains all Geotic, Gaean, and Rheatic worlds.  
- Overlaps with Xenotic worlds in the rocky mass range.  
- Worlds like Mars, Titan, Io, and Kepler-20b are all Tellurics, despite wildly different surface conditions.
**Symbolic Use**  
- The term draws from *Tellus*, the Latin Earth-mother, but in this context is **geostructural**, not biological.  
- When contrasted with *Xenotic*, the distinction is about **structure** (rocky vs. exotic or gaseous), not life-hosting potential.
