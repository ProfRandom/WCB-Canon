Margaret Turnbull and Jill Tartar* have listed some criteria that stars would need to have in order to be what they call a “habstar” — one likely to have an Earth-like planet orbiting it. Among their criteria, they list that the star should:
1. Be on the Main Sequence;
2. Be non-variable;
3. Have a habitable zone;
4. ***Be at least 3 billion years of age***.

This last criterion is critical (for our purposes perhaps the most important), because it automatically disqualifies any star which has a main sequence lifetime of $Q < 3.0$ Ga.  This means that a “habitable star” needs to have a current age of *no less* than 65% that of the Sun, and a total Main Sequence lifetime of *at leas*t 30% that of the Sun ($3.0$ Ga; $0.300$⊙).

## Identifying A Maximum Spectral Class

For a star with $Q = 3.0⊙$, using our Main Sequence Stellar Equations of State:

![[Main Sequence Stellar Equations of State ✓]]

We can approximate a relative temperature of:
$$
T = Q^{-0.2} = 0.3^{-0.2} = 1.272⊙
$$
… which is a Kelvin temperature of:
$$
K = 5800T \approx 7379
$$
Consulting our [[Stellar Thermal Interval Constant Table ✓]]
![[Stellar Thermal Interval Constant Table ✓]]

… we see that this Kelvin temperature falls into the F-Class range, which has a TIC of $þ = 150$.

Applying our Spectral Class calculation from Kelvin temperature:
$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal{S} &= \dfrac{\kappa - K}{þ} \\ \\
 &= \dfrac{7500 - 7379}{150} \\ \\
 &= \dfrac{121}{150} \\ \\
\mathcal{S} &= 0.807 \\ \\
\end{align}
$$So, no Main Sequence star above spectral type F0.81 will have _total Main Sequence lifetime_ long enough to qualify as "habitable".

Since we have specified (in [[M002 - Stars — 08 `Sun-Like` Stars]]) that the spectral type range for stars with perannual orbits within the parahabitable zone (see [[M002 - Stars — 04 Thermozone Orbits]]), and since F2 is "later" on the spectral class continuum than F0.81, we know that all stars defined as "solar analogs" have lifetimes long enough to be "habitable" system hosts.
#### Relating Stellar Ages to Appearance and Evolution of Life

The earliest fossils of complex multicellular life appear about **600 million years ago**, and the earliest fossils widely accepted as animals are from the phylum _Cnidaria_† — marine species that show up in the record around **580 million years ago** during the late Ediacaran, just before the Cambrian Explosion. Taking the accepted age of the Earth as **4.56 billion years**, this means Earth was about **4.0 billion years old** (~88% of its present age) before complex life began to appear.

If we assume a similar pace of biological development for complex life on other Earth-like exoplanets, then any star with a main sequence lifetime of **≤ 3.0 billion years** would leave its habitable planets without enough time for complex life to evolve indigenously — ending its stable phase at least a billion years too soon. (This does not preclude such worlds from supporting transplanted or migratory complex life.)

On the other hand, the **Great Oxygenation Event**‡ — which shifted Earth’s atmosphere from one dominated by carbon dioxide and methane to one with persistent oxygen levels above ~15% — occurred around **2.4 billion years ago**, when Earth was roughly **2.16 billion years old** (~47% of its current age). The gap between that oxygenation and the first appearance of complex animals was thus about **1.8 billion years**. This suggests that, in principle, complex life _could_ arise at any time after oxygenation, but on Earth the delay was geologically long.

For our purposes, we can specify that an Earth-analog planet must be at least **~2.0 billion years old** to have plausibly developed an aerobic atmosphere by biological means, and at least **~4.0 billion years old** to have produced indigenous complex life. The **minimum** planetary age for being (in)habitable to human colonists is therefore the lesser of these: **~2.0 billion years**.

A star with a main sequence lifetime of **3.0 billion years** could host an Earth-analog planet that had time to produce an oxygenated atmosphere, and then remain stable for roughly another **1 billion years** before leaving the main sequence. Such a system could be colonized by humans or other oxygen-breathing life, even if indigenous complexity had not yet evolved. The next step is to determine which spectral classes meet this **≥ 3 Ga** lifetime criterion.
