## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Defines **asteroids** as **Small Star System Bodies (S3Bs)**‚Äîthe smallest, most numerous members of a stellar system‚Äôs mononic population.  
- Describes them as **lithic or carbonic monons** occupying the **micromonon‚Äìminimonon** mass range, typically cohesion-bound and non-hydrostatic.  
- Establishes the **Asteroidal Morphotype**, encompassing multiple **conformations** that vary by primordial composition and formation zone.  
- Identifies principal conformations: **C-type, S-type, M-type, D-type, P-type, V-type**, and transitional intermediates.  
- Explains that these conformations represent gradients of **volatility, metallicity, and thermal history**, producing the compositional zoning seen in mature asteroid belts.  
- Notes that S¬≥Bs collectively serve as **chemical and dynamical fossils** of stellar-system evolution, illustrating how minor bodies preserve the record of protoplanetary processes.  

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **S3B (Small Star System Body)** ‚Äî colloquial collective for subplanetary monons within a stellar system.  
- **Asteroidal Morphotype [mono].**  
- **C-, S-, M-, D-, P-, V-type Conformations [conf].**  
- **Micromonon, Minimonon [mono].**  
- **Volatility Gradient [chem].**  
- **Thermal History [evo].**  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- **Asteroidal Morphotype [mono]** formally defined in *Meta 3 ‚Äî Morphotypes*.  
- **S3B [mono]** usage consistent with *Planemos 1 ‚Äî Framework and Equations*.  
- **C‚ÄìP-type Conformations [conf]** align with established lithic and carbonic forms.  
- **Density and composition correlations [phys]** cross-referenced with *Monons 2 ‚Äî Properties and Parameters*.  
- **Status:** [EXPANDED] ‚Äî adds physical detail, compositional taxonomy, and system-level context for small-body populations.  



## ü™® Asteroid Types  

Asteroids ‚Äî or, more broadly, **Small Star System Bodies (S3Bs)** ‚Äî are not all alike.  
Their compositions reflect **where in the protoplanetary disk** they formed, and they tend to cluster into **compositional families** within belts and resonance niches.  
### üîπ Main Classes (by composition)  

- **C-type (Carbonaceous)**  
  *Dark, primitive, volatile-rich.*  
  - Very common in outer belts.  
  - High water/ice content.  
  - Analogues: many outer-belt asteroids, comet precursors.  

- **S-type (Silicaceous)**  
  *Rocky, stony, silicate-rich.*  
  - Common in inner belts.  
  - Often parent bodies of ordinary chondrite meteorites.  
  - Analogues: much of the inner main belt.  

- **M-type (Metallic)**  
  *Iron‚Äìnickel cores of disrupted proto-planets.*  
  - Often mid-belt objects.  
  - Dense, high radar reflectivity.  
  - Analogues: 16 Psyche and smaller metallic fragments.  
### üîπ Other Notable Types  

- **D-type / P-type**  
  *Reddish, organic-rich, volatile-rich.*  
  - Very dark, low density.  
  - Found in outer belt, Trojans, and beyond.  

- **K-type / Q-type**  
  *Intermediate spectra.*  
  - Less common.  
  - Transitional between S and C types.  

- **V-type (Vestoids)**  
  *Basaltic surface fragments.*  
  - Pieces of differentiated crust.  
  - Example: fragments of 4 Vesta.  
### üîπ Worldbuilder shorthand  

- **Inner belts (hotter):** S-types (rocky).  
- **Middle belts (mixed):** M-types (metallic).  
- **Outer belts (colder):** C-types (carbonaceous/icy).  
- **Beyond snow line:** D/P-types (icy/organic, comet-like).  
### üìñ Worldbuilder takeaway  
When you divide a belt with resonances, don‚Äôt just think ‚Äúempty lanes.‚Äù  
Each sub-belt can be **compositionally distinct**: rocky inside, metallic mid-belt, icy/carbonaceous outside.  
This makes your belts feel *alive* with variety, and gives explorers something to discover besides ‚Äúmore rocks.‚Äù
