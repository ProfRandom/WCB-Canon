> 🎯 *Build plausible fictional worlds with narrated formulas and practical modeling tools — no calculus required.*

# WorldCrafting 101: A Science-Adjacent Worldbuilding Toolkit

> "Because sometimes you just want to build a world you can actually use."

## 📘 Project Purpose

WorldCrafting 101 is a self-paced, science-adjacent toolkit for worldbuilders, writers, game masters, and simulation enthusiasts who want to design plausible planets, stars, and systems — without needing a physics degree.

This guide balances scientific plausibility with creative flexibility, delivering fully worked formulas, step-by-step examples, and enough explanation that readers understand both *what* they're doing and *why* they're doing it.

**Sed ego dico.** Sometimes creative decisions outweigh strict science — and that’s okay.

## 🔧 What You'll Need

- Basic algebra
- Occasional trigonometry (fully explained)
- Familiarity with spreadsheets (helpful, not required)
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment

No calculus. No hand-waving. Fully narrated examples accompany every formula.

## 📦 Module Structure

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **01 — Habitable Planet Builder** | Build an Earthlike world step-by-step |
| **02 — Planetary Systems** | Build full star systems (coming soon) |
| **03 — Stellar Classes** | Classify stars and define habitable zones (coming soon) |
| **04 — Moons & Satellites** | Add moons, Roche limits, and stability zones (coming soon) |

## 🔖 Attribution Note

This project adapts and synthesizes models from published astrophysics and planetary science sources. Where science leaves gaps, creative extensions are introduced transparently for worldbuilding purposes.
