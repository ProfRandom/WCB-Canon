# WorldCrafting101: A Science-Adjacent Worldbuilding Toolkit

> "Because sometimes you just want to build a world you can actually use."

---

## 📘 Project Purpose

WorldCrafting101 is a self-paced, science-adjacent toolkit for worldbuilders, writers, game masters, and simulation enthusiasts who want to design plausible planets, stars, and systems — without needing a physics degree.

This guide balances scientific plausibility with creative flexibility, delivering fully worked formulas, step-by-step examples, and enough explanation that readers understand both *what* they're doing and *why* they're doing it.

> **Sed ego dico.** — Because I say so.  
> **Sed phantasiae.** — Because... fantasy.  
> **Mundus tuum est.** — It’s your world.

## 🔧 What You'll Need

- Basic algebra
- Occasional trigonometry (fully explained)
- Familiarity with spreadsheets (helpful, not required)
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment

No calculus. No hand-waving. Fully narrated examples accompany every formula.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Meet Your Companions

To make this guide a little more fun (and hopefully a little more helpful), you’ll occasionally encounter two recurring voices:

- **Hiparistarchus Ptolemeus Galileopernicum ("Hippy")** — Our conservative traditionalist. He clings to classical models, worries about edge cases, and politely nags about technical details.

- **Keplarius Braheus ("Keppy")** — Our enthusiastic challenger. He eagerly asks "What if we push this?" and loves playing with edge cases and speculative scenarios.

Think of them as your study buddies — they raise the kinds of questions you're likely thinking as we work through models together.

## 🔖 Attribution Note

This project adapts and synthesizes models from published astrophysics and planetary science sources. Where science leaves gaps, creative extensions are introduced transparently for worldbuilding purposes.

If you believe any source has been overlooked or attribution could be improved, feel free to open an issue — corrections are always welcome.
