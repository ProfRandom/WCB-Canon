All terms match the diagram above.\n## 📘 Glossary of Ellipse Parameters All variables match the labeled diagram above. ### 🔹 Core Axes & Foci - a — semi-major axis   - b — semi-minor axis   - c — linear eccentricity (center to focus)   - e — eccentricity (dimensionless) = \\(\\dfrac{c}{a}\\)\n- Describes how “stretched” the ellipse is.\n- \\(e = 0\\) → perfect circle\n- \\(0 &lt; e &lt; 1\\) → ellipse\n- \\(e = 1\\) → parabola (degenerate case)\n- \\(e &gt; 1\\) → hyperbola (not an ellipse)\n- Eccentricity is unitless and invariant under scale.\n- It also defines the ellipse as a conic: \\[\n  \\dfrac{\\text{distance to focus}}{\\text{distance to directrix}} = e\n\\] - f — flattening \\(b = 1 - \\dfrac{b}{a}\\)   - i — major axis \\(=2a\\)   - j — minor axis \\(=2b\\)   - P, A — primary vertices - X, Y — co-vertices (±b along minor axis)   - C — center of ellipse   - f₁, f₂ — the two foci   ### 🔹 Derived Lengths\n- d — focus-maximus = vertex to opposite focus \\(= a + c\\)   - g — focus-minimus = focus to nearest vertex  \\(= a - c\\) (e.g. \\(f_1P\\))   - h — focal span \\(=2c\\)   - ℓ — semi-latus rectum \\(=\\dfrac{1}{2} q\\)   - q — latus rectum \\(= 2ℓ\\) ### 🔹 Directrix System\n- m — center-to-directrix \\(=\\dfrac{a}{e}\\)   - n — focus-to-directrix \\(=m - c\\) - s — vertex-to-directrix \\(=m - a = \\dfrac{c}{e} - a\\)   ## 🧮 Canonical Equations ### 🔹 Geometric - \\(c = ae\\)   - \\(b = a\\sqrt{1 - e^2}\\) - \\(a = \\sqrt{b^2 + c^2}\\) ### 🔹 Orbital Geometry - \\(f = a(1 - e^2) = \\dfrac{b^2}{a}\\)   - \\(r(\\theta) = \\dfrac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e \\cos \\theta}\\)   - \\(r_p = a(1 - e)\\) ### 🔹 Directrix Relationships - \\(m = \\dfrac{a}{e}\\)   - \\(s = m - a = \\dfrac{c}{e} - a\\)   - \\(n = m - c = \\dfrac{a}{e} - c\\) ## 📐 What Is the Directrix? For an ellipse, the directrix is:\nFormally: \\[\\dfrac{\\text{distance to focus}}{\\text{distance to directrix}} = e\\] This defines the ellipse! ## 📏 Where Is the Directrix?\nThere are two directrices, one on each side of the center, at a distance: \\[m = \\dfrac{a}{e}\\] … from the center, where: - a is the semi-major axis\n- e is the eccentricity\nSo: - Right-side directrix: \\(x = \\dfrac{a}{e}\\)\n- Left-side directrix: \\(x = -\\dfrac{a}{e}\\)​ If e → 0, the directrix moves off to infinity — which makes sense, because a circle (eccentricity 0) has no directrix-like behavior. ## 🎯 How the Directrix Relates to the Ellipse You can think of the ellipse as a set of points where: \\[\\dfrac{PF}{PD} = e\\] Where: - PF is the distance from a point P on the ellipse to a focus\n- PD is the distance from that same point P to the directrix\nThis definition is symmetric and constructive: it’s how conics are defined in classic geometry. ## 💡 So What Does It Do? The directrix is mostly a definitional and constructional tool — not something we see in physical orbits, but: - It gives us a clean formula for an ellipse in Cartesian coordinates: \\[r(\\theta) = \\dfrac{p}{1 + e \\cos \\theta} \\quad \\text{where } p = \\dfrac{b^2}{a}\\] - It shows up in ray-tracing, parabolic reflectors, classical mechanics, and procedural shape generation. ## 🔍 Quick Facts\nEach row lists two known parameters and what you can solve from them using canonical identities.\nKey Terms & Symbols:\n- Exponents, roots, logs (standard algebra rules).\n- Variables for bounds: u (upper), l (lower), s (sum), d (difference), r (ratio), m (mean), p (product), q (quotient).\n- Percentages: p, x, n, v.\n- Σ = summation over integer ranges.\n- Metallic mean: Nₓ.\n- Line equations: slope (m), intercept (b), points (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂).\n- Temperature variables: F (Fahrenheit), C (Celsius), K (Kelvin).\nCross-Check Notes:\n- Functions as a toolbox reference rather than a conceptual note.\n- Reinforces WCB’s SANC principle: simple, approximate, notationally clear.\n- Purely mathematical — no worldbuilding-specific notation introduced beyond standard algebra.\n- Should remain a utility reference to support other canon notes.\nA reference sheet of exponent and logarithm rules useful in constructing systems of thermal, gravitational, orbital, and energetic relationships in scientifically-grounded worldbuilding.",

This seems like a reasonable figure, since the closest star to Sol is Proxima Centauri, at about 4.2 light-years away.\nThe bright star, Deneb (α Cygni) is 2600 light-years from the Sun. That’s not a long distance compared to the galactic neighborhood (the Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million light-years away), and certainly not on the scale of the visible universe, which is currently calculated to be 93 billion light-years across.\nIf we think about what the term “light-year” actually means, we begin to intuit a problem. A light-year is the distance light travels in one Earth year, so light takes a little under 4 years and 2½ months to get here from there. Light (the fastest thing in the universe) coming from Deneb takes 2,600 years to reach us from there. In terms of human timeframes, light we see from Deneb today started its journey here the year Cambyses I became King of Persia. Never heard of him? That’s kind-of my point.\nCurrently, the most distant human-made object in the universe is Voyager 1, which also has the fastest heliocentric recession speed of any artificial object at about \\(17\\) kilometers per second. It did its flyby of Saturn in 1980, and NASA officially marksedthe start iof ts journey out of the Solar system on January 1, 1990, almost \\(35\\) years ago, as of this writing. In that time, it has traversed \\(168\\) Astronomical Units. One AU is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, which is, on average, \\(146.9\\) million kilometers. That puts Voyager \\(25,132,458,000\\) (25 billion) kilometers away.\nThat is a distance of \\(\\mathbf{0.0027}\\) light-years. Yes, you read that right. In \\(35\\) years, Voyager I has covered about \\(\\mathbf{\\dfrac{1}{370}}\\) of a light-year. It will take in another \\(16483.74\\) years to travel a full light-year, and when it reaches that distance, there will still be about \\(3\\) light-years of empty space around it in every direction. It will take \\(70217.39\\) years to reach the distance of Proxima Centauri (though Voyager 1 isn’t headed to Proxima Centauri).\nObviously, the propulsion methods we currently have at our disposal are not going to get us to the stars any time soon.\nOne way to circumvent this problem is to find ways to travel faster than even light does. (Can somebody please quiet down Einstein in the back of the room there?). Drives which accomplish faster-than-light (FTL) velocities have been posited in a wide variety of science fiction novels, movies, television shows, etc. Hyperdrive, among the earliest (in film at least) was mentioned in Forbidden Planet (1956), (more on thisbelow), but probably the first FTL system to become widely known (and copiously copied) was certainly Star Trek’s “warp drive”.",

    "text": "7.1 Boosting The Speed\nIn Star Trek: The Next Generation (ST:TNG), the assumption was that warp technology had been improved upon since the days of Kirk and Spock, and warp factors were redefined to be: \\[\nv = f^\\frac{10}{3}\n\\] So now, warp 8 is: \\[\nv = f^\\frac{10}{3} = 8^\\frac{10}{3} = 1024c\n\\] … which exactly doubles the old warp 8 velocity and shortens the trip to Proxima Centauri to 1.5124 days, or about 36.3 hours. Still not an afternoon stroll.\nThe star Deneb is 2600 lightyears from the Sun. At ST:TOS warp 8, the Enterprise would take \\[\nT = \\frac{2600}{512} = 5.078\\; \\textit{years}\n\\] to get there. The ST:TNG Enterprise, at its warp 8 cuts the trip in half to a mere 2.54 years.\nAnd, yet, in the very first episode of ST:TNG, “Encounter at Farpoint” (1987), the mission destination is stated to be Deneb IV. Such a designation is usually assumed to refer to the fourth planet orbiting a star named “Deneb”. Based on this, we can assume Picard and company’s destination was the Deneb we just calculated a 2.54 year one-way journey to.\nFurther more the Star Trek wiki site, Memory Alpha states that “By 2373, the Federation’s territory was spread across 8000 lightyears….” Assuming this to be a circular diameter, it would take ST:TNG Enterprise \\[\nT = \\frac{8000}{1024} = 7.8125\\; \\textit{years}\n\\] to traverse the width of the Federation.\n\nNote: If we take that to mean 8000 cubic lightyears, that’s a spherical volume of only about \\[\nr = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3V}{4\\pi}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3\\cdot8000}{4\\pi}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{24000}{4\\pi}} = \\sqrt[3]{1909.86} ≈ 12.41\\; \\text{lightyears}\n\\] … in radius, which seems a bit on the small side, doesn’t it?\n\nStar Trek: Voyager (ST:VOY) used the same warp formula as ST:TNG, up to warp 9, and then an unspecified exponential curve thereafter, such that warp 10 is infinite velocity. Most fan sources estimate Voyager’s top speed of 9.975 to be 3000c, but that still means that a cross-Federation journey would take: \\[\nT = \\frac{8000}{3000} = 2.67\\; \\textit{years}\n\\] The Sol-Deneb run mentioned earlier would take: \\[\nT = \\frac{2600}{3000} = 0.867\\; \\textit{years} ≈ 316.6\\; \\textit{days}\n\\] … which is just over 10 standard months… and that’s assuming no stops along the course.\nClearly while Star Trek warp drive is fast, interstellar distances make the travel times comparable to steamships crossing the Atlantic in the early 20th Century.",

    "title": "5  Abstract",
    "section": "9.1 Space Folding and Jump Drives",
    "text": "9.1 Space Folding and Jump Drives\n\n9.1.1 Space Folding\nPerhaps the best-known example of “space-folding” comes from Frank Herbert’s Dune universe. Spacing Guild Navigators, their mental faculties expanded by the spice melange, cause two distant points in space to momentarily overlap, like bending a sheet of paper so that a point 1” from each opposing margin are brought into contact. At that moment, a ship could physically relocate from origin to destination without traversing the intervening void (which, for that moment, would not actually exist). When space “unfolds,” the ship is simply there. For all practical purposes, the voyage is instantaneous — it takes longer to ride the shuttle up to orbit at origin and back down at destination than it does to cross between worlds.\nThis, of course, is entirely speculative (or outright fantastical), and even if realizable, would demand at least Kardashev Type IV technologies — the ability to manipulate energy on galactic scales. Yet from a worldbuilding perspective, instant travel shifts the storytelling focus: the challenge is no longer the journey, but who controls the technology/mechanology of travel and transportation. ### Jump Drives Jump drives accomplish much the same function as space-folding, but by mechanotechnological (mechtech) means rather than mystical or mental ones. The “FTL jumps” of Battlestar Galactica (both versions) are a classic example, as is the “blink drive” in Dark Matter.\nDepending on the needs of the setting, a jump drive may require measurable amounts of time and energy, or it may be treated as effectively instantaneous — “supertech” that simply relocates a ship. Likewise, jumps may be chained one after another, or require a recharge interval before firing again.\nFrom a worldbuilding standpoint, these choices are critical: do you want drama from fuel shortages, from cooldown tension, from misjumps into the void — or from the sheer ease of hopping anywhere instantly? The math is malleable, but the drama comes from the limits you set.\nThis is why such mechtech is often preferred by more speculative writers: you don’t have to wrestle with the intractable realities of hard science. Instead, the means recedes into the background, letting the drama occupy the foreground — focusing on the characters and their story. ### Practicum With space-folding and jumpdrives, etc., instead of determining a maximum velocity in terms of lightspeed, one might specify a maximum traversable distance per jump, limited by available drive power, fuel consumption, or whatever other constraint one may choose to impose.\nFor instance, let’s posit an interstellar civilization, the Serelem Union which has developed a “vault drive” with the parameters: - Individual vaults can span any distance between 1 and 100 light-years - The more extensive the vault, the more energy required - The more extensive the vault, the longer the drive takes to recharge, such that - The vault-to-charge ratio is 1 minute of recharge per light-year of the most recent previous vault.\nNow let posit the Serelemene flagship, Tonqua, is on a defense/rescue mission to their most distant outpost on a planet called Rylboru, \\(4835\\) lightyears from the homeworld. How long does it take Tonqua to get there (we’ll be using Earth-normal time units here for convenience)?\nThe number of vaults required depends on the chosen vault magnitude. At one light-year per vault, it is \\(4835\\) vaults; at 100 light-years per vault it is \\(48.35\\) vaults (or, more likely \\(48\\) vaults of \\(100\\) light-years and a final vault of \\(35\\) light-years.). Let’s say Captain Talua decides to make \\(100\\) light-year vaults. That means that after each vault, the Tonqua will have to spend 100 minutes recharging its drive before it can vault again. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT &= 48\\;\\text{vaults} \\times 100\\;\\text{minutes} = 4800\\;\\text{minutes} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\frac{4800\\;\\text{minutes}}{60\\;\\text{minutes/hour}} = 80\\;\\text{hours} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\frac{80\\;\\text{hours}}{24\\;\\text{hr/day}} = 3.\\overline{3}\\;\\text{days} \\\\[0.5em]\n&≈ 3\\;\\text{days, } 8\\;\\text{hours}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] (We don’t need to account for the recharge time after the last \\(35\\) light-year vault, because it will transpire at the destination.)\nThis equates to an apparent velocity of: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv &= \\frac{D}{T} = \\frac{4800}{3.\\overline{3}} = 1440\\;\\text{light-years per day} \\\\[0.5em]\n&\\text{Remember that the last vault adds recharge time, but not travel time!} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 1440\\;\\text{ly/day} \\times 365.25\\;\\text{days} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 525960\\;\\text{light-years per year} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 525960c \\\\[1.5em]\nf_{TOS} &= \\sqrt[\\frac{10}{3}]{525960} = 80.721\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] To put it another way, a ST:TOS ship at warp \\(8\\) would need \\(9.44\\) days to cover the same distance.\n\nNote that the travel time is the same regardless of how the vaults are chosen, arranged. - \\(1000\\) vaults of 1 minute recharge each is still a total of \\(4800\\) minutes of recharge - \\(100\\) vaults of \\(24\\) light-years means \\(2400\\) minutes of recharge; completing the trip with \\(2400\\) vaults of 1 light-year is another \\(2400\\) minutes of recharge, for, again, a total of \\(4800\\) minutes of recharge.\n\nLooking back at our ship speed listing from earlier this makes Tonqua - About \\(\\frac{1}{17}\\) times as fast as the Millennium Falcon - Approximately \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) as fast as the GunStar - Around \\(1.44\\) times faster than the Moya - Exactly \\(6\\) times faster than the Orville - More-or-less \\(548.45\\) times faster than the PIllar of Autumn - Precisely \\(2435\\) times faster than ST:TOS warp 6 ### Wormholes and Stargates\nTravel by wormhole, as in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine or Stargate, achieves the same end as space-folding or jump drives, but by exploiting a hypothesized natural phenomenon: conduits in spacetime that connect two distant points through a substrate (or superstrate) of “normal” space.\nNaturally occurring wormholes may have permanently fixed endpoints: you enter one end of the Chunnel and you always exit the other. Or they may be unstable: opening and closing at unpredictable intervals; fixed at one end but wandering at the other; or even distorting time so that traversal involves dilation — or outright time travel.\n\nImagine a milieu in which an advanced civilization builds a galaxy-spanning civilization by means of a wormhole, unaware that one end of the conduit is temporally displaced by millennia. If physical travel between the two termini is impossible, would the discrepancy in eras even matter?\n\nAnother dramatic limitation, as in Stargate, is when wormholes are generated by mechtech devices. In that case, both origin and destination must host a physical machine — which can itself be relocated, creating the possibility of shifting or contesting endpoints.\nAs always, one may specify instantaneous or finite-time traversal, and decide how such wormholes are powered. The physics can be left hand-wavy — what matters for world_building_ is how these limits shape drama, conflict, and control.\nThe worldmaker will be confronted with a decision in designing interstellar polities. You either: 1. Invent your space-traversing technology, determine its limitations, and design the volumetric span of your civilization based on the longest necessary travel-time; or, 2. Create your milieu, including the size of your civilization’s sphere of influence, and then design a drive that lets your characters get around that volume of space in reasonable amounts of time.",

    "text": "9.2 Example: The Kaltai Entente\nLet’s specify a moderately sized elliptical galaxy (Shuf) of \\(10\\) billion stars, spanning \\(350000\\) light-years. The Kaltai Entente is a federated polity of cooperative star systems that extends \\(1500\\) light-years in radius out from the central star (Kaltai). Thus, the Entente commands a spherical volume of about \\(14\\) billion cubic light-years, encompassing \\(56.5\\) million star systems of which about \\(13\\) million are habitable/hospitable systems around F-, G-, and K-type stars. That’s a lot of space (and stars, and planets) to watch over.\nLet’s further say that the military-supported trade syndicate (KaltaiSys) has a monopoly on the modes of FTL space travel, and that there are no space-folding drive, or jump drives, or wormhole, etc. All travel is inherently time-consumptive, distance-over-rate. Their fastest battle cruisers can make the trip between Kaltai and their most distant colony at Taibano Raimos, 1500 light-years away, in 10 days.\nThus, these ships are capable of: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nr &= \\frac{1500\\;\\text{light years}}{10\\;\\text{days}} = 150\\;\\text{ly/day} \\\\[0.5em]\nv &= 150\\;\\text{ly/day} \\times 365.25\\;\\text{days/yr} = 54787.5\\;\\text{light-years/yr} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 54787.5c\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] This equates to: - ST:TOS warp \\(37.9\\) - About \\(12.5\\)% faster that a Wraith hive ship in Stargate: Atlantis; and - \\(62.5\\)% of the top speed of the Orville\nIf your game, story, or show can tolerate a 10-day lag between core and frontier, then this drive system fits your setting. But if you need supplies, reinforcements, or diplomacy to move faster than that — and you don’t want to shrink your sphere of influence — you have only two real options: - Reconfigure your FTL. Make the drive faster, reduce recharge, or relax the limits you’ve set.\n- Invent another traversal process. Wormholes, jump drives, fold engines, or some other mechanism that bypasses the distance–rate bottleneck altogether.\nThe Lorentz term is a factor of how much the local passage of time, length (in the direction of motion), and relativistic mass change when an object is in motion. \\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}\n\\] Where: - \\(\\beta\\) = the velocity expressed as a percentage of the speed of light \\(^v/_c\\).\nAll motion results in some magnitude of the Lorentz term (GPS satellites have to take it into account to return accurate results). As velocity increases, the Lorentz term increases exponentially.\nThis equation was developed by the Dutch Physicist Hendrik Lorentz in the late \\(19^{th}\\) century as part of a broader set of equations called the Lorentz transformations. He developed these as part of his effort to determine whether or not a cosmic space-filling substance (luminous æther) existed. (It doesn’t).\nWhen it became clear that all electromagnetic phenomena, including visible light, has wavelike properties, it was believed that all waves needed a physical medium through which to propagate. It was reasoned, then, that there must be a substance filling “empty” space in which light waves moved. Yet all attempts to detect or measure the qualities of this æther failed.\nAn early explanation of the failure of these experiments was that linear distances might be compressed in the direction of motion due to pressure from the æther building up against the forward faces of the object. If this were true, then light waves and any measuring device would also be compressed along the same vector and so a measurment would always return the same value because all elements of the system were being altered by the same ratio.\nLorentz developed his equations to calculate the amount of compression that motion through the æther would cause. When Michelson and Morley’s experiments showed that the æther did not exist — and did not need to — the math itself did not vanish. Lorentz had the equations right, but the context wrong. A generation later, Einstein reinterpreted them: not as distortions caused by a cosmic medium, but as the natural geometry of spacetime itself.\nEinstein’s recontextualizing of the Lorentz transformations shows that, as the velocity of an object such as a space ship approaches the speed of light, the ship’s linear dimension in the direction of motion contracts — so that much of the theory was true, there just wasn’t any substance physically causing the contraction.\nEinstein also realized that for the object in motion, time passes more slowly by the same Lorentz factor (though to an observer on or in the moving object, no change in the “flow” of time is apparent). And, finally, the kinetic mass of the ship (as measured by an outside observer), also increases by the same factor of the Lorentz term. Thus, the speed of light, the passage of time, and mass are all constant for every observer. A passenger onboard a ship with a velocity of 0.99c would measure a rod as a meter long, while to an outside observer, the rod would appear shorter by the factor: \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\gamma} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.99^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.98} = \\sqrt{0.0199} = 0.1411\n\\] To the outside observer, the rod would appear to be only about \\(14.1\\) cm in length.\n\nNote: this shows that while length contracts, time expands and mass increases. To calculate - Length contraction: multiply by \\(\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\) - Time dilation (expansion): multiply by \\(\\gamma\\). - Mass increase: multiply by \\(\\gamma\\).\n\nFor example: to those inside the ship, one minute would be sixty seconds long. To those looking in from outside, a minute on the ship would last: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\gamma &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.99^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.98}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0199}} = \\frac{1}{0.1411} = 7.089 \\\\[0.5em]\nT_\\gamma &= 60 \\times 7.089 ≈ 425\\;\\text{seconds}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] … just over 425 seconds — or 7.089 minutes (7ᵐ 5.33ˢ).\nA \\(50\\)-kilogram person stepping on a scale onboard ship would see the scale report their weight as \\(50\\) kilograms, but if an exterior observer were able to measure the person’s mass, they would see them weighing almost \\(355\\) kilograms. Also, if the person onboard the ship made a round trip of \\(50\\) years according to their clock, they would return to find that almost \\(355\\) years had passed on Earth!\n\nThis is the source of the so-called “Twin Paradox”: if one twin makes a round-trip journey at \\(0.99\\)c of \\(10\\) years by their own clock, they will return to find that about \\(71\\) years have passed on Earth. If both twins were both \\(20\\) years old at departure, the traveler will return at age \\(30\\) — to a sibling who has aged through all of those \\(71\\) years and is now \\(91\\) years old, making the stay-at-home twin \\(\\mathbf{61}\\) years older than their traveling sibling.\n\nThis shows that at rest (in one’s own reference frame) the Lorentz term is 1.0, but as soon as any motion is applied, a Lorentz term comes into effect — small at first but growing rapidly as the velocity approaches the speed of light. At 0.9999c, the Lorentz term is: \\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9999^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9998}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0000199}} = \\frac{1}{0.01411} = 70.7\n\\] Table of Lorentz Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.9\n2.294157339\n\n\n0.99\n7.08881205\n\n\n0.999\n22.36627204\n\n\n0.9999\n70.71244595\n\n\n0.99999\n223.6073568\n\n\n0.999999\n707.1069579\n\n\n0.9999999\n2236.068034\n\n\n0.99999999\n7071.067814\n\n\n0.999999999\n22360.68009\n\n\n\nThis is the source of the common expression “nothing can travel faster than light”; at the speed of light it would require an infinite amount of energy to increase velocity by the minuscule amount needed to “break the light barrier”. ## The Dramatic Side of Relativity One of the “features” of relativity is that there is no “correct” frame of reference. We’ve noted above that the crew of a ship traversing at 0.99c still measures a minute as 60 seconds, whereas to “back home” that “minute” lasts 7 minutes and 5.33 seconds.\nAt velocities even closer to the speed of light, the dilation becomes even more pronounced. You might only experience 10 biological years aboard ship (assuming you don’t spend most of the trip in cryostasis), but the “wider universe” may experience tens of thousands of chronological years. It might happen that “back home” invents a warp drive 10 years into your journey and you arrive at your destination to find that it was colonized and tamed 9500 years ago and nobody actually remembers who you are.\nThe concept of “age” would necessarily take on new meaning. Let’s revisit the 0.99c scenario and make you the traveling twin.\nAssuming cryostasis slows your aging down to 1 year out of every 10 years of ship-time, you’ll have only biologically aged a year on your journey, so your “bioage” (let’s keep the word “age” to refer to this) is only 21. Your “proper age” is 11 years more than that (let’s call that your “scope”); and the chronological duration since you were born is 71 years (we’ll call that your “span”)… So you are 21 years of age; 30 years “scoped”, and 91 years “spanned”.\nA $1 you left in a high-yield savings account before your departure may have appreciated into billions — or your culture may have completely changed its material wealth concept and you have no wealth at all under the new system. Perhaps you carried a million dollars worth of diamonds with you on your journey, but “back home” found and began mining a diamond planet 7 years after you left and now that compressed carbon in your pocket is literally more common than dirt….\nThe worldbuilding opportunities are endless, and endlessly fascinating.",

    "text": "10.1 Catastrophic Impacts From Microparticles\nWhile your environment onboard ship feels “normal” to you, the Lorentz factor has had its effects on the “outside” universe. A dust particle that would be practically massless under “normal” circumstances may have several tons of relativistic mass if it hits your ship.\nSo, any vessel traversing at relativistic speeds needs to be protected from the energy release of any such impacts on its hull. The necessary thickness (and mass that has to be accelerated) of a physical shield grows as a function of the Lorentz factor as velocity increases, so a point of diminishing returns is reached almost instantly.\nIn many science fiction milieux, this problem is avoided by either of two means: 1. Either the ship is in a “bubble” of some kind, the nature of which absorbs or deflects any such incoming missles; or 2. The ship is fitted with some kind of energetic field of force (commonly called a “shield”) which either deflects the impactors or absorbs the energy of their collision with it.",

Objects previously radiating in the ultraviolet would gradually become visible and grow redder until they, too, passed beyond the visible red end of the spectrum.\nLight from the stars ahead of you would become progressively more blue-shifted toward the ultraviolet. Those already radiating in the violet end of the spectrum would disappear from view. Objects previously only radiating in long wavelengths below red would emerge into the visible spectrum, progressively grow bluer, and finally, they, too would pass out of the visible range into the ultraviolet. The light coming toward you would also become progressively more and more energetic until it was as if you were stationary at some finite distance from the Big Bang, itself.\nLight from the stars out the side windows would be similarly shifted, to a greater or lesser extent depending on how far away from you they were. Ultimately, all the light arriving at your location would become compressed into a rainbow like a belt around your ship (at no measurable distance_, with utter blackness “ahead” and “behind” it. Red would be at the “back” end, violet at the “front” end, and the other colors of the spectrum distributed between the two extremes.\n\nAnd you probably wouldn’t want to be looking out a glass window, anyway, because you’d be microwaved or gamma rayed before you had a chance to marvel at the spectacle.",

No, we’re not happy about it, either (don’t shoot the messenger).\nFor example:\n- The Sun, at 5800K, is classified as a G2 star —\n- Spectral Class: G\n- Spectral Type: 2\n\n7.1.0.1 Note on Spectral Type Precision in WCB\nIn this system, a spectral type is defined by its numerical position within a spectral class. For example: - G2, G2.3, and G2.9 are all Type 2\n- The decimal simply adds interpolation precision — it does not define a new type. - Therefore, Type 2 refers to the full range ⟨2.0 ∧ 2.999···⟩ within class G.\n\nThis allows for relatively simple mathematical treatment of the relationship between spectral type (T) and surface temperature (K). \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{S} &= \\dfrac{\\kappa - K}{þ} \\\\ \\\\\n\\kappa & = \\mathcal{S} þ + K \\\\ \\\\\nK &= \\kappa - \\mathcal{S} þ \\\\ \\\\\nþ &= \\dfrac{\\kappa - K}{\\mathcal{S}} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhere: - K = the star’s surface temperature in Kelvin - κ = the upper bound temperature of the relevant spectral class - þ = the thermal interval constant for the relevant spectral class - \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) = the spectral type number #### The Thermal Interval Constant (þ) Where does þ come from? For a given spectral class þ can be calculated by: \\[\nþ = \\dfrac{high\\;temp - low\\;temp}{10}\n\\]\nHere is the above table with these constants added:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectralClass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n25000\n55000\n3000\n\n\nB\n10000\n25000\n1500\n\n\nA\n7500\n10000\n250\n\n\nF\n6000\n7500\n150\n\n\nG\n5000\n6000\n100\n\n\nK\n3500\n5000\n150\n\n\nM\n2400\n3500\n110\n\n\nL\n1300\n2400\n110\n\n\nT\n600\n1300\n70\n\n\nY\n300\n600\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.0.2 Example\nLet’s run the numbers for the Sun - Known surface temperature: 5800K - Checking the table, 5800K falls between 5000K and 6000K, so the Sun is spectral class G - The high temperature (κ) for spectral class G is κ 6000K - The thermal interval constant (þ) for spectral class G is þ = 100 - What is the Sun’s spectral type (\\(\\mathcal{S}\\)) Running the numbers: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{S} &= \\dfrac{\\kappa - K}{þ} \\\\\n\\mathcal{S} &= \\dfrac{6000 - 5800}{100} \\\\\n\\mathcal{S} &= \\dfrac{200}{100} \\\\\n\\mathcal{S} &= 2\\;✓\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The Sun is spectral type G2.\nReversing the process: - The known spectral class of the Sun is G - The known spectral type of the Sun is \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) = 2 - The high temperature (κ) for spectral class G is κ 6000K - The thermal interval constant (þ) for spectral class G is þ = 100 - What is the Sun’s Kelvin temperature (K) Running the numbers: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nK &= \\kappa - \\mathcal{S} þ \\\\\nK &= 6000 - (2)(100) \\\\\nK &= 6000 - 200 \\\\\nK &= 5800\\;✓\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The surface temperature of the Sun is 5800K.\n\n\n7.1.1 Converting Between Absolute Kelvin (K) And Solar Relative (T)\nNothing could be simpler: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT &= \\dfrac{K}{5800} \\\\ \\\\\nK &= 5800T\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] For instance: the Sun’s surface temperature is K = 5800: \\[\nT = \\dfrac{K}{5800} = \\dfrac{5800}{5800} = 1\\;✓\n\\] Conversely, the Sun’s relative temperature is T = 1.0: \\[\nK = 5800 T = (5800)(1) = 5800\\;✓\n\\] ### Fictional Examples Let’s say we have a star called Essem that we want to be spectral type F3.65. What is its Kelvin temperature? - The surface temperature for spectral class F is K ∈ ⟨6000 ∧ 7500⟩. - The thermal interval constant for spectral class F is þ = 150. Working through the equation: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nK &= \\kappa - \\mathcal{S} þ \\\\\nK &= 7500 - (3.65)(150) \\\\\nK &= 7500 - 547.5 \\\\\nK &= 6952.5\\;✓\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] What is Essem’s relative surface temperature? \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT = \\dfrac{K}{5800} \\\\ \\\\\nT = \\dfrac{6952.5}{5800} \\\\ \\\\\nT = 1.199\\;✓\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Essem’s relative temperature is T = 1.199⊙.\nWorking The Other Direction\nLet us say that Essem has a near neighbor, Essel, and we know that its relative temperature is T = 0.876⊙. What is its spectral type?\nFirst, convert T to K by: \\[ K = 5800T = (5800)(0.876) = 5080.8\\;✓ \\] Looking at our table we see that this value falls in spectral class G:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectralClass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n5000\n6000\n100\n\n\n\n… which gives us all the other information we need: - G-class high temperature is κ = 6000 - G-class thermal interval constant is þ = 100\nThe spectral type is: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{S} &= \\dfrac{\\kappa - K}{þ} \\\\ \\\\\n\\mathcal{S} &= \\dfrac{6000 - 5080.8}{100} \\\\ \\\\\n\\mathcal{S} &= \\dfrac{919.2}{100} \\\\ \\\\\n\\mathcal{S} &= 9.192\\;✓\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Essel’s spectral type is G9.192. ### Parameter Ranges By Spectral Class",

    "section": "9.2 The Nucleal Orbit",
    "text": "9.2 The Nucleal Orbit\nThe average distance from Earth to the Sun — about \\(1.496 \\times 10^8\\) km — is defined as one astronomical unit (AU). Due to Earth’s slightly elliptical orbit, this distance varies by approximately ±2.5 million km between Earth’s closest approach to and farthest distance from the Sun.\nSo, for all practical (and thesiastic) purposes, the Earth’s orbital distance (a) is a = 1.0AU. In fact a is the commonly used symbol for any orbital distance when it is expressed in Astronomical Units.\nFor our purposes, I have revived an old word from the dusty backroom shelves of English — nucleal — and given it new life:\n\nNucleal Orbit (\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)): the orbital distance from any given star at which a planemon receives the same stellar irradiance as Earth receives from the Sun at 1 AU.\n\n… and given it the utterly unimaginative symbol, \\(\\mathcal{N}\\).\nThe important thing to note here is that \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is not constant, but varies from star to star, and it is calculated by: \\[\n\\mathcal{N} = \\sqrt{L}\n\\] Where: - L = the Luminosity of the star in relative units\nObviously for the Sun: \\[\n\\mathcal{N} = \\sqrt{L} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n\\] &gt; Keppy: So for a dimmer star N shifts closer to the star?\n\nHippy: And for a brighter star, it shifts farther out from the star.\n\nCorrect on both counts. And once we know \\(\\mathcal{N}\\), we can express the habitable zone (details coming!) as a proportional range around it. For instance, for a star of half the Sun’s luminosity \\(L = 0.5⊙\\): \\[\n\\mathcal{N} = \\sqrt{L} = \\sqrt{0.5} = 0.7071\\;AU\n\\] ### The Nucleal Orbit and the Habitable Zone A quick survey of the existing literature reveals a commonly held definition for the habitable zone as: \\[\n\\langle0.950 \\wedge 1.385\\rangle \\mathcal{N}\n\\] … or, in other words: between 95% of the nucleal orbit distance to 1.385 times (138.5%) the nucleal orbit distance. In the case of our hypothetical \\(L = 0.5⊙\\) star and its \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) nucleal orbit, the range of its habitable zone calculates to: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{N} = 0.7071\\; AU \\\\\n\\text{Inner Edge} = 0.950 \\mathcal{N} = (0.950)(0.7071) = 0.6717\\; AU \\\\\n\\text{Outer Edge} = 1.385 \\mathcal{N} = (1.385)(0.7071) = 0.9793\\; AU\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] &gt; Keppy: So … the outer edge of this star’s habitable zone is closer to its star than Earth orbits from the Sun…..\nExactly. But, this region is only a part of a total star system. ### The Ontozones – Two Habitable Zones To start with, some scientist posit a wider, more “optimistic habitable zone” region, covering: \\[\n\\langle0.750 \\wedge 1.770\\rangle \\mathcal{N}\n\\] For our purposes, we call this wider spread the actual habitable zone and we call the narrower span the hospitable zone, so that the hospitable zone comprises a middle lane between the extremes of the habitable zone: \\[\n\\dfrac{1.385 - 0.95}{1.77 - 0.75} = \\dfrac{0.435}{1.02} = 0.4265\\;AU\n\\] … about 42.65% of it, in fact.\n\n\n\nOrbital Range\n\n\n\n\n\n⟨0.750 ∧ 0.950⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHabitable Zone\n\n\n⟨0.950 ∧ 1.385⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHospitable Zone\n\n\n⟨1.385 ∧ 1.770⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHabitable Zone\n\n\n\nIt has also been suggested that “desert” planemons (think Dune, Tattooine) might orbit in the zone between ⟨0.500 ∧ 0.750⟩N and we might call this the “desert planemon zone”, which would be, by definition, parahabitable to habitable (but mostly the former).\n\n\n\nOrbital Range\n\n\n\n\n\n⟨0.500 ∧ 0.750⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nParahabitable\n\n\n⟨0.750 ∧ 0.950⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHabitable Zone\n\n\n⟨0.950 ∧ 1.385⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHospitable Zone\n\n\n⟨1.385 ∧ 1.770⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHabitable Zone\n\n\n\n\n9.2.1 The Frost Line (ϝ)\nResearch indicates that beyond a distance of about \\(a = 4.850\\;AU\\) in our Solar system, water cannot remain liquid due to insufficient irradiance from the Sun. This distance is sometimes termed the “Frost Line” or “Ice Line”, and an orbital distance of \\(a = 4.850N\\) is the value we set for this outer limit.\nFor instance: - Mars’ orbit in our own Solar system is \\(a = 1.524\\;AU\\), well within the \\(1.770N\\) limit - The asteroid belt is ≈ ⟨2.2 ∧ 3.2⟩AU, beyond \\(1.77\\mathcal{N}\\), but still within the \\(4.850\\;AU\\) ϝ limit. This region in our Solar system does not host a sizeable planemon (and likely never did), but if one were to exist there, it would probably be parahabitable due to the orbital distance from the Sun.\nThis gives us another range of orbits we can add to our accounting:\n\n\n\nOrbital Range\n\n\n\n\n\n⟨0.500 ∧ 0.750⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nParahabitable\n\n\n⟨0.750 ∧ 0.950⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHabitable Zone\n\n\n⟨0.950 ∧ 1.385⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHospitable Zone\n\n\n⟨1.385 ∧ 1.770⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHabitable Zone\n\n\n⟨1.770 ∧ 4.850⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nParahabitable\n\n\n\nJupiter’s orbit is at \\(a = 5.204\\;AU\\), well beyond the \\(4.850\\;AU\\) limit, and things just get colder from there, so we can specify that if any kind of “life” does exist in this region it is likely to be extremophile by Earth standards, which WCB denotes as “xenotic”.\n\n\n\nOrbital Range\n\n\n\n\n\n⟨0.500 ∧ 0.750⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nParahabitable\n\n\n⟨0.750 ∧ 0.950⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHabitable Zone\n\n\n⟨0.950 ∧ 1.385⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHospitable Zone\n\n\n⟨1.385 ∧ 1.770⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHabitable Zone\n\n\n⟨1.770 ∧ 4.850⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)N\nParahabitable\n\n\n4.850\\(\\mathcal{N}\\) →\nXenotic\n\n\n\nSimilarly, any “life” that might come to be on a body orbiting closer than 0.500N would also be xenotic:\n\n\n\nOrbital Range\n\n\n\n\n\n← 0.500\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nXenotic\n\n\n⟨0.500 ∧ 0.750⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nParahabitable\n\n\n⟨0.750 ∧ 0.950⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHabitable Zone\n\n\n⟨0.950 ∧ 1.385⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHospitable Zone\n\n\n⟨1.385 ∧ 1.770⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHabitable Zone\n\n\n⟨1.770 ∧ 4.850⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nParahabitable\n\n\n4.850\\(\\mathcal{N}\\) →\nXenotic\n\n\n\nFinally, we differentiate between inner and outer zones, and define notations for each:\n\n\n\nOrbital Range\n\nNotation\n\n\n\n\n← 0.500\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nInner Xenotic Zone\n\\(Z_{IX}\\)\n\n\n⟨0.500 ∧ 0.750⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nInner Parahabitable Zone\n\\(Z_{IP}\\)\n\n\n⟨0.750 ∧ 0.950⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nInner Habitable Zone\n\\(Z_{IH}\\)\n\n\n⟨0.950 ∧ 1.385⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nHospitable Zone\n\\(Z_{H}\\)\n\n\n⟨1.385 ∧ 1.770⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nOuter Habitable Zone\n\\(Z_{OH}\\)\n\n\n⟨1.770 ∧ 4.850⟩\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\nOuter Parahabitable Zone\n\\(Z_{OP}\\)\n\n\n4.850\\(\\mathcal{N}\\) →\nOuter Xenotic Zone\n\\(Z_{OX}\\)\n\n\n\nThis gives us a full inventory of orbital limits for any star system we choose to devise.",

    "section": "10.2 The Perannual Orbit",
    "text": "10.2 The Perannual Orbit\nThere is one remaining essential star system orbit, which I have called the perannual orbit. The word comes from the Latin per annum, meaning “per year” or “each year”, and the name reflects that this is the orbit in any star system which has an orbital period (P) of exactly one Earth year. ##### IMPORTANT &gt; “One Earth Year” in this case is the duration of Earth’s complete orbit around the Sun relative to the larger reference frame of the “fixed” stars; thus this is called the sidereal year, from the Latin sidus, “star”. This is measured and denoted in terms of ephemeris days — which are defined to be exactly 86400 seconds in duration. Thus, the sidereal year (and, consequently, the perannual year) has a duration of: \\[\\\n\\begin{aligned}\n365.256363004 \\quad \\text{Ephemeris Days} \\\\\nor \\\\\n365^d\\;6^h\\;9^m\\; 9.763545^s\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] &gt; This is not a “year” as experienced by inhabitants on the surface of a planemon on this orbit (that is called the tropical year, which is in part dependent upon the rotational period of the planemon, itself); this is the sidereal year. &gt; &gt; Please see [[Units and Measures of Time ✓]] for a more in-depth discussion of this topic.\nWe denote the perannual year as \\(\\mathcal{P}\\), and its location in the star system is not constant (the same as the nucleal orbit (\\(\\mathcal{N}\\)) but is determined by the mass of the star(s), and – to a small but measurable degree – by the mass of the planemon.\nPlease see [[M002 - Stars — 06 Relating the Nucleal and Perannual Orbits ✓]] for an in-depth exploration of this relationship.\nThe perannual orbit is determined not by the luminosity of the star(s) in the system but by mass, mostly of the stars(s), but the mass of the planemon can become a calculatory relevant factor if it is a significant fraction of the mass of the star(s).\nThe perannual orbit is an orbital distance, but it is predicated on the period of that orbit — how long it takes the planemon to complete one entire orbit (measured in Earth years). ANY planemon orbital period is calculated (in relative terms) by: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    P &= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{a^3}{M+m}} \\\\\n    a &= \\sqrt[3]{P^2 (M+m)} \\\\\n    M + m &= \\dfrac{a^3}{P^2} \\qquad \\text{Believe it or not, this has its uses}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Where: - P = the planemon’s orbital period in Earth sidereal years - a = the measure of the semi-major axis of the planemon’s orbit - M = the mass of the star(s) in Solar masses - m = the mass of the planemon (also expressed in Solar) masses\nIn many cases (such as that of Earth), m is such a small number that it can be ignored without drastically altering the value of P. In the case of Earth:\n\n\\(M = 1⊙\\)\n\\(m = 0.000003003\\)⊙ (\\(3.003 \\times 10^{-6}\\)) — three millionths of the Sun’s mass\n\\(a = 1\\;AU\\)\n\nCalculating with only the Sun’s mass: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    P &= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{a^3}{M}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1^3}{1}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{1}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\\;\\text{years}       \n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Calculating with both masses: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    P &= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{a^3}{M + m}} \\\\\n     &= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1^3}{1 + 0.000003003}} \\\\\n     &= \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{1.000003003}} \\\\\n     &= \\sqrt{0.999997} \\\\\n     P &= 0.9999985\\;\\text{years}       \n\\end{aligned}\n\\] … a difference of about 47.384 seconds.\n\n🔍 Takeaways: &gt;The perannual orbit defines the location in any star system where a planemon would complete one sidereal Earth year. &gt;It may be closer-in than the nucleal orbit (intranucleal) or farther out than the nucleal orbit (extranucleal). &gt;If it is ever the same as the nucleal orbit, then the star(s)’ mass(es) must be \\(M = 1⊙\\), and — ideally — the planemon’s mass must be \\(m = 1⨁\\). &gt;Unlike the nucleal orbit (which depends on stellar irradiance), the perannual orbit depends only the mass of the system — and serves as a temporal rather than thermal reference point.\n\nAs shown above, the distance of any orbit can be calculated from the period and the masses via: \\[\na = \\sqrt[3]{P^2 (M+m)}\n\\] … but if we already know that \\(P = 1\\), it drops out of the equation: \\[\na = \\sqrt[3]{M+m}\n\\] … such that the distance of the orbit is simply the cube-root of the sum of the masses.\nFor clarity, we denote the distance of the perannual orbit with a \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) (for perannual), so our equation becomes: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{P} &= \\sqrt[3]{M+m} &&\\text{When taking into account both masses} \\\\\n\\mathcal{P} &= \\sqrt[3]{M} &&\\text{When using only the central mass} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",

These two are not limiting distances, but orbital environs which both describe and contribute to the ontosomic nature of planemons.\nAs a quick review: - Nucleal Orbit: that orbit (expressed in AU) at which a planemon receives from its star(s) the same radiant flux as Earth receives from the Sun at one Astronomical Unit distance, calculated by: \\[\n    \\mathcal{N} = \\sqrt{L}\n\\]\nWhere L = Luminosity of the star(s) as expressed in Solar units, ⊙\n\nPerannual Orbit: that orbit (expressed in AU) which has an orbital period of exactly one sidereal Earth year, calculated by: \\[\n\\mathcal{P} = \\sqrt[3]{M+m}\n\\] If we disregard the mass of the planemon m: \\[\n\\mathcal{P} = \\sqrt[3]{M}\n\\] And we saw in [[M002 - Stars — 02 Parameters ✓]] that through relationship: \\[\nM = \\sqrt[3]{L}\n\\] This means that:\nThe perannual orbit can be approximated directly from the luminosity by: \\[\n\\mathcal{P} \\approx \\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt[3]{L}} \\approx \\sqrt[6]{L}\n\\]\nThe nucleal orbit can be approximated directly from the mass by: \\[\n\\mathcal{N} \\approx \\sqrt{M^3}\n\\] And, by extension either can be approximated from the other by: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{P} &\\approx \\sqrt[6]{mathcal{N}^2} \\approx \\sqrt[3]{\\mathcal{N}} \\\\\n\\mathcal{N} &\\approx \\mathcal{P}^3\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] REMEMBER\nBoth \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) are measured in astronomical units, not time!\nThese last four equations are approximations; in most cases they’ll be “accurate enough”, but calculating\\(\\mathcal{N}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) robustly is always advised.",

    "text": "13.2 Calculating Other Orbits\nThis brings us to methods of calculating other orbits in a star system. In practice, any method the worldmakerchooses is valid, including just putting planemons where “it feels right”; however, even using this method should ideally take into account the above statistics and try to avoid an orbital interval between a given planemon and its nearest neighbor of \\(&lt; 1.500\\;AU\\) or \\(&gt; 2.000\\;AU\\).\n\n13.2.1 Starting From A Known Orbit\nMost of the time, you’ll have pre-established a particular orbit — usually either the nucleal or the perannual orbit, and want to arrange other planemons in the system relative to that orbit. Notating this orbit as the base orbit, we can set up two processes for calculating orbits inferior to (closer-in than) and superior to (farther-out than) that orbit.\nIntrabasal Orbit Calculation Process \\[\nr_i = B;\\; \\Omega = \\text{«▢»}: \\qquad\nr_{i-1} = \\frac{r_i}{⟨⟨ \\text{min} ∧ \\text{max} ⟩⟩}\n\\quad \\text{while } r_{i-1} ≥ \\Omega\n\\] Extrabasal Orbit Calculation Process \\[\nr_i = B;\\; \\Omega = \\text{«▢»}: \\qquad\nr_{i+1} = r_i \\cdot ⟨⟨ \\text{min} ∧ \\text{max} ⟩⟩\n\\quad \\text{while } r_{i+1} ≤ \\Omega\n\\] Where: - B = basal orbital radius (e.g. the nucleal orbit \\(\\mathcal{N}\\)) - Ω = orbital distance cuttoff (minimum or maximum allowed orbit based on the star system constraints)\n\n\n13.2.2 Usage Strategy\nAssuming the medial orbital interval range \\(I \\in ⟨⟨1.200 ∧ 3.500⟩⟩\\;AU\\): The intrabasal and extrabasal forms can be used independently depending on your desired anchoring strategy:\n\nInward-Only Generation\nIf you begin at the basal orbit (innermost, nucleal, perannual, etc.), use the intrabasal form to expand inward via divisive steps: \\[\nr_0 = B;\\; \\Omega = «▢»:\n\\quad r_{i-1} = \\dfrac{r_i} {⟨⟨1.200 ∧ 3.500⟩⟩}, \\text{ while } r_{i-1} ≥ \\Omega\n\\] Where: - Ω = the minimum safe orbital distance — usually taken to be \\(a = 0.100\\;AU\\).\n\n\nOutward-Only Generation\nIf you begin at an innermost orbit (e.g. a thermal, Roche, or design constraint), use the intrabasal form to expand outward via multiplicative steps: \\[\nr_0 = B;\\; \\Omega = «▢»:\n\\quad r_{i+1} = r_i \\cdot ⟨⟨1.200 ∧ 3.500⟩⟩, \\text{ while } r_{i+1} ≤ \\Omega\n\\] Where: - Ω = the farthest orbit desired for a planemon in the system — based on whatever criterion desired, but physically limited to the Hill Sphere radius of the central mass.\n\n\nApplying these methods can fully define a system. - If one wanted to start with the innermost safe orbit; e.g. \\(B = 0.100\\;AU\\), then one would use only the extrabasal process to calculate orbits outward. - Conversely if one wanted to start with the most distant orbit, then one would use only the intrabasal process to calculate orbits inward.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT If not starting from the perannual or nucleal orbit, always check randomized orbits against either (or both) to ensure proper interval gaps fall to either side of that orbit, and adjust accordingly!",

    "text": "9.1 Stars: The Next Generation\n\nKeppy: So, will there be a Generation IV?\n\nProbably not — and here’s why: - While there is certainly still star-forming going on in the universe (the Orion Nebula, for instance), the stars forming there are still Population I/Generation III stars. - The gasses and heavier elements that are going into their composition aren’t changing in relative proportions over time. - Supper massive stars are still producing heavy elements, and novae and supernovae are still distributing those elements into the cosmos, the overall amounts of such heavy elements is not increasing, and heavy elements are not being produced at a faster rate than in the past.\nNewly formed stars, then don’t have basic compositions in any fundamental way different from the previous generation.\n\nIn fact, if the “heat death” model of the universe is correct, star formation will decrease with time, neutron stars, quark stars, and black holes will eventually replace self-luminous fusors, and everything will settle into a “steady state” that will persist for eternity.## Abstract\nMajor Topics:\n- Examines how stellar main sequence lifetimes constrain system habitability and the emergence of complex life.\n- Draws on Turnbull & Tarter’s external “habstar” criteria (not adopted into WCB lexicon):\n- Must be main sequence, non-variable, have a habitable zone, and age ≥ 3.0 Ga.\n- Establishes that any star with Q &lt; 3.0 Ga cannot be considered habitable for long-term biospheres.\n- Using WCB’s Main Sequence Equations of State, calculates the spectral class threshold:\n- F0.81 or later → main sequence lifetime ≥ 3.0 Ga.\n- Confirms that “solar analogs” (F2 and later, through K and M) meet this criterion.\n- Biological timeline analogies from Earth:\n- Great Oxygenation Event (~2.4 Ga ago; at ~47% Earth’s current age).\n- Appearance of complex life (~600 Ma ago; at ~88% Earth’s current age).\n- Implications:\n- Earth-analog worlds must be ≥ 2.0 Ga old for aerobic atmospheres to arise.\n- ≥ 4.0 Ga old for complex indigenous life.\n- Minimum “colonizable” planetary age ~2.0 Ga.\n- Provides tabulated stellar lifetimes by spectral class:\n- O, B, A: too short (&lt; 3 Ga).\n- F: borderline (2.36–7.46 Ga).\n- G, K, M, L: comfortably long (≥ 7.46 Ga to trillions of years).\n\nKey Terms & Symbols:\n- Q [sci]: stellar main sequence lifetime (in Ga or ⨀-relative).\n- Great Oxygenation Event [sci].\n- Solar Analog [sci].\nCross-Check Notes:\n- Stellar lifetimes and solar analog ranges already canonical; this file reframes them in terms of biological timescales.\n- Habstar is an external term; acknowledged here but not adopted into WCB usage.\n- Status: [EXPANDED] — expands canon with habitability timescales and biological evolution benchmarks.",

    "text": "10.1 Identifying A Maximum Spectral Class\nFor a star with \\(Q = 3.0⊙\\), using our Main Sequence Stellar Equations of State:\n![[Main Sequence Stellar Equations of State ✓]]\nWe can approximate a relative temperature of: \\[\nT = Q^{-0.2} = 0.3^{-0.2} = 1.272⊙\n\\] … which is a Kelvin temperature of: \\[\nK = 5800T \\approx 7379\n\\] Consulting our [[Stellar Thermal Interval Constant Table ✓]] ![[Stellar Thermal Interval Constant Table ✓]]\n… we see that this Kelvin temperature falls into the F-Class range, which has a TIC of \\(þ = 150\\).\nApplying our Spectral Class calculation from Kelvin temperature: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{S} &= \\dfrac{\\kappa - K}{þ} \\\\ \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{7500 - 7379}{150} \\\\ \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{121}{150} \\\\ \\\\\n\\mathcal{S} &= 0.807 \\\\ \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]So, no Main Sequence star above spectral type F0.81 will have total Main Sequence lifetime long enough to qualify as “habitable”.\nSince we have specified (in [[M002 - Stars — 08 Sun-Like Stars]]) that the spectral type range for stars with perannual orbits within the parahabitable zone (see [[M002 - Stars — 04 Thermozone Orbits]]), and since F2 is “later” on the spectral class continuum than F0.81, we know that all stars defined as “solar analogs” have lifetimes long enough to be “habitable” system hosts. #### Relating Stellar Ages to Appearance and Evolution of Life\nThe earliest fossils of complex multicellular life appear about 600 million years ago, and the earliest fossils widely accepted as animals are from the phylum Cnidaria† — marine species that show up in the record around 580 million years ago during the late Ediacaran, just before the Cambrian Explosion. Taking the accepted age of the Earth as 4.56 billion years, this means Earth was about 4.0 billion years old (~88% of its present age) before complex life began to appear.\nIf we assume a similar pace of biological development for complex life on other Earth-like exoplanets, then any star with a main sequence lifetime of ≤ 3.0 billion years would leave its habitable planets without enough time for complex life to evolve indigenously — ending its stable phase at least a billion years too soon. (This does not preclude such worlds from supporting transplanted or migratory complex life.)\nOn the other hand, the Great Oxygenation Event‡ — which shifted Earth’s atmosphere from one dominated by carbon dioxide and methane to one with persistent oxygen levels above ~15% — occurred around 2.4 billion years ago, when Earth was roughly 2.16 billion years old (~47% of its current age). The gap between that oxygenation and the first appearance of complex animals was thus about 1.8 billion years. This suggests that, in principle, complex life could arise at any time after oxygenation, but on Earth the delay was geologically long.\nFor our purposes, we can specify that an Earth-analog planet must be at least ~2.0 billion years old to have plausibly developed an aerobic atmosphere by biological means, and at least ~4.0 billion years old to have produced indigenous complex life. The minimum planetary age for being (in)habitable to human colonists is therefore the lesser of these: ~2.0 billion years.\nA star with a main sequence lifetime of 3.0 billion years could host an Earth-analog planet that had time to produce an oxygenated atmosphere, and then remain stable for roughly another 1 billion years before leaving the main sequence. Such a system could be colonized by humans or other oxygen-breathing life, even if indigenous complexity had not yet evolved. The next step is to determine which spectral classes meet this ≥ 3 Ga lifetime criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n130.41 ka\n3.18 Ma\n\n\nB\n3.18 Ma\n326.33 Ma\n\n\nA\n326.33 Ma\n2.36 Ga\n\n\nF\n2.36 Ga\n7.46 Ga\n\n\nG\n7.46 Ga\n19.02 Ga\n\n\nK\n19.02 Ga\n101.32 Ga\n\n\nM\n101.32 Ga\n658.83 Ga\n\n\nL\n658.83 Ga\n11.78 Ta\n\n\n\nReferences Margaret C.

Shortly after its formation, its luminosity was about \\(70\\%\\)1 of its current value, and the luminosity has experienced an average increase of about \\(6.7\\%\\) per billion years to its present value. When the Sun was 1 billion years old, its luminosity was about \\(76.7\\)% of its current value of \\(3.828 \\times 10^{26}\\) W. Thus the habitable zone limits and the nucleal orbit of a star, all of which are dependent upon its luminosity, will also be different depending on its age, and vary as the star ages.\nFor instance, the habitable zones for the Sun on its billion-year birthday were: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_0 = 0.500\\sqrt{0.767} = 0.438 \\\\\nH_1 = 0.750\\sqrt{0.767} = 0.6578 \\\\\nH_2 = 0.950\\sqrt{0.767} = 0.832 \\\\\nN = \\sqrt{0.767} = 0.876 \\\\\nH_3 = 1.385\\sqrt{0.767} = 1.213 \\\\\nH_4 = 1.770\\sqrt{0.767} = 1.550 \\\\\nH_5 = 4.850\\sqrt{0.767} = 4.248 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Compare these numbers with the semi-major axes of the Solar terrestrial planets: at that time, Venus was 0.066 AU within the optimistic habitable zone (it’s \\(0.027\\) AU outside now) and Mars was within the optimistic habitable zone by \\(0.026\\) AU. (Neither was within the conservative habitable zone.) The Earth was \\(0.124\\) AU beyond the nucleal orbit at that time.\n\n\n\nPlanet\nOrbit\n\n\n\n\nMercury\n0.387\n\n\nVenus\n0.723\n\n\nEarth\n1.000\n\n\nMars\n1.524\n\n\n\nThus, while Venus is demonstrably uninhabitable now, it is possible (perhaps likely) that it was a far more habitable planet 3.0 billion years in the past (especially if its rotational period were more-or-less what it is now) as is discussed in a Scientific American article by Shannon Hall from August 2016 titled “Hellish Venus Might Have Been Habitable for Billions of Years”.2",

    "text": "10.2 The Sun’s Future ‘Habitable Zones’\nThe Sun’s luminosity will increase as it ages, pushing the habitable zone limits outward from where they are now. Because the rate at which the Sun uses up its hydrogen fuel increases as its temperature increases, its luminosity will grow by an average of \\(18.42\\) per billion years going forward.\nSo, in about \\(600\\) ka, the luminosity of the Sun will have increased enough that it will begin to have deleterious effects on Earth: CO₂ levels in the atmosphere will begin to drop, negatively impacting Earth’s flora. By 1 billion years from now, all complex Earthly life will be gone: the loss of plants will lead to the loss of herbivores, and consequently the carnivores which feed on them. Shortly after this time, Earth’s water will begin to evaporate wholesale, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect which will eventually bake away any and all remaining microbial life, as well.3\nBy around 5.5 billion years from now (when the Sun is about 10 billion years old and nearing the end of its Main Sequence lifetime) the Sun’s luminosity will have increased to about \\(2.02\\) times its current value, yielding the following figures for the habitable zone limits and the nucleal orbit at that time: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_0 = 0.500\\sqrt{2.02} = 0.711 \\\\\nH_1 = 0.750\\sqrt{2.02} = 1.066 \\\\\nH_2 = 0.950\\sqrt{2.02} = 1.350 \\\\\nN = \\sqrt{2.02} = 1.421 \\\\\nH_3 = 1.385\\sqrt{2.02} = 1.947 \\\\\nH_4 = 1.770\\sqrt{2.02} = 2.516 \\\\\nH_5 = 4.850\\sqrt{2.02} = 6.893 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] So, by that time, Venus may very well be mostly molten, Earth will be desiccated and sterilized, Mars will be just \\(0.103\\) AU beyond the new nucleal orbit, and Jupiter (at \\(5.204\\) AU), will be within the outer boundary of the parahabitable zone.\nThereafter, the Sun will enter its red giant phase and its luminosity will shoot up dramatically, as will its diameter, utterly engulfing Mercury and rendering Venus and Earth into hellish, lifeless balls of mostly molten rock.4\nKey Terms & Symbols:\n- Thermozone — Habitable zone (HZ) limits derived from √L scaling.\n- Nucleal Orbit (N) — Central HZ reference orbit (√L).\n- Lₑdd (Eddington limit) — Maximum luminosity scaling for massive stars.\n- Perannual Orbit (𝓟) — Orbital distance yielding a one-year (Earth sidereal) period.\n- Terran-hospitable — Worlds truly habitable by unmodified humans.\n- Mathematically parahabitable — Worlds calculable as within HZs but uninhabitable in practice.\nCross-Check Notes:\n- Expands habitable zone framework by highlighting limitations of stellar lifetimes and radii.\n- Connects to Stellar Lifetimes and System Habitability (short giant lifespans).\n- Introduces terminology to distinguish theoretical HZs from practical human-centered habitability.",

    "text": "11.1 Stellar Radius Becomes a Significant Factor\nAldebaran’s radius is the Sun’s radius of \\(695,700\\) km \\(\\times 44.2 = 30,749,940\\) km. One astronomical unit is \\(149.6\\) million kilometers, which means that Aldebaran’s radius measures \\(0.206\\) astronomical units.\nThus, were Aldebaran to replace the Sun in the Solar system, its surface would fall only about \\(0.387 – 0.206 = 0.181\\) AU (≈ \\(27\\) million km) inside Mercury’s orbit.\n\nAldebaran’s true mass is measured at \\(1.16 M⊙\\)​. If, however, we incorrectly applied the main-sequence radius–mass scaling, we’d get \\(M \\approx 67.34⊙\\)​; the main-sequence luminosity–mass scaling would give \\(M \\approx 4.959⊙\\)​. Both are wildly wrong — illustrating why Main Sequence relations must only be applied to Main Sequence stars; using them on evolved stars like Aldebaran gives wildly misleading results.\n\nUsing Aldebaran’s correct (measured) mass value, its perannual orbit falls at \\(\\mathcal{P} =\\sqrt[3]{1.16} = 1.051\\) AU, which is only \\(0.845\\) AU beyond the star’s surface.\nAldebaran’s habitable zone limits and nucleal orbit calculate to be: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_0 = 0.500\\sqrt{439} = 10.476 \\\\\nH_1 = 0.750\\sqrt{439} = 15.714 \\\\\nH_2 = 0.950\\sqrt{439} = 19.905 \\\\\nN = \\sqrt{439} = 20.952 \\\\\nH_3 = 1.385\\sqrt{439} = 29.019 \\\\\nH_4 = 1.770\\sqrt{439} = 37.086 \\\\\nH_5 = 4.850\\sqrt{439} = 101.619 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The orbital period of the nucleal orbit is: \\[\n\\mathcal{N}_p = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{20.952^3}{1.16}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{9197.94}{1.16}} = \\sqrt{7929} = 89.05 \\text{ years}\n\\] … or about \\(54\\%\\) of Neptune’s orbital period.\n\n11.1.1 Extending Into The Supergiant Realm\nThe theoretical maximum mass for a star is 200 M⊙. We can’t use the standard \\(L=M^{3.8}\\) equation for stars above about 20 M⊙, so we have to choose the lesser between: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nL &= k \\times M^{1.5}\\;, \\text{where } k=1.12 \\times10^3 \\\\[1em]\n&\\text{or} \\\\\nL_{Edd} &= 3.2 \\times 10^4 \\left(\\dfrac{M_*}{M_⊙}\\right)L⊙ \\quad \\text{(The Eddington Limit)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] In our case the equations return: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nL_{MS} &= 1.12 \\times 10^3 \\times (200^{1.5}) = 1.12 \\times 10^3 \\times (2.828 \\times 10^3) = 3.168 \\times 10^6 \\\\[1em]\n&\\text{and} \\\\\nL_{Edd} &= 3.2 \\times 10^4 \\left(\\dfrac{200}{1}\\right)L⊙ = 6.4 \\times 10^6\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] … so we’d go with the \\(L_{MS}\\) value, and calculate the thermozone limits by: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_0 &= 0.500\\sqrt{3.168 \\times 10^6} = 889.94 \\\\\nH_1 &= 0.750\\sqrt{3.168 \\times 10^6} = 1334.92 \\\\\nH_2 &= 0.950\\sqrt{3.168 \\times 10^6} = 1690.89 \\\\\nN &= \\sqrt{3.168 \\times 10^6} = 1779.89 \\\\\nH_3 &= 1.385\\sqrt{3.168 \\times 10^6} = 2465.14 \\\\\nH_4 &= 1.770\\sqrt{3.168 \\times 10^6} = 3150.40 \\\\\nH_5 &= 4.850\\sqrt{3.168 \\times 10^6} = 8632.46 \\quad \\text{(almost 14\\% of a lightyear)} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] … but a perannual orbit of only \\[\n\\mathcal{P} = \\sqrt[3]{M} = \\sqrt[3]{200} = 5.848\\;\\text{AU}\n\\] … which is 18.152 AU inside the minimum estimated 24 AU radius of such a star.\n\n\n11.1.2 Working With a Known Star\nThe largest known star currently is Stephenson 2-18, with a radius of \\(R = 2150⊙\\;(9.999AU)\\), a measured luminosity of \\(L = 440000⊙\\), and an upper estimated mass value of \\(M = 45⊙\\). These values yield thermozone limits of: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_0 &= 0.500\\sqrt{440000} = 331.66 \\\\\nH_1 &= 0.750\\sqrt{440000} = 497.49 \\\\\nH_2 &= 0.950\\sqrt{440000} = 630.16 \\\\\nN &= \\sqrt{440000} = 663.32 \\\\\nH_3 &= 1.385\\sqrt{440000} = 918.71 \\\\\nH_4 &= 1.770\\sqrt{440000} = 1174.09 \\\\\nH_5 &= 4.850\\sqrt{440000} = 3217.13 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] … and a perannual orbit of: \\[\n\\mathcal{P} = \\sqrt[3]{M} = \\sqrt[3]{45} = 3.557\\;\\text{AU}\n\\] … 6.442 AU inside the radius of the star.\n\nRemember: Such hypergiants live only a few million years at most, far too short for Terran-like biospheres to develop. (See [[Stellar Lifetimes and System Habitability ✓]] for details.) ## Conclusion You can calculate thermozones (and hence orbital architectures) for giant and supergiant stars, but their immense radii, unstable envelopes, and short lifespans mean those thermozones don’t correspond to genuinely habitable real estate. In Protagorean terms, they fail the human-centered test: such systems are not Terran-hospitable, though they may be mathematically parahabitable —that is, capable of hosting planets that humans could use (for energy, staging, or resource acquisition) without being worlds where Terran-like life would be expected to evolve. (Of course, whether truly alien xenotics might arise under such extreme conditions is another matter entirely.) ## Abstract\nMajor Topics:\n- Critiques the traditional stellar spectral sequence (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) as inconsistent, non-linear, and historically accreted rather than systematically designed.\n- Highlights specific discontinuities (e.g., F9 → G0 only ~150 K, while F0 → F9 spans ~1350 K) to show irregular subclass gaps.\n- Explains how the Worldmaking framework (WCB) resolves these issues by adopting a linearized spectral system:\n- Each class is assigned a clean, evenly divided temperature range.\n- Subclasses interpolate predictably across the scale.\n- Enables symbolic clarity, ease of computation, and consistency with habitability modeling.\n- Distinguishes use cases:\n- Use traditional astrophysical data when realism is desired.\n- Use the lin Add notWCBwhy WCB uses neologisms (septi-, okti-, etc.) ale (WCB): evenly spaced subclasses across temperature ranges.\n- Thermozones: orbital/temperature relationships tied to stellar classification.\n\nCross-Check Notes:\n- Complements M002 — Stars: 01WCBectral Classes (which already introduces the linearized scale).\n- This note serves as a sidebar critique and justification for adopting the WCB linearized system.\n- No new glossary terms or symbols required; all terms already established in existing canon.",

    "section": "9.1 The History of Magnitudes",
    "text": "9.1 The History of Magnitudes\n\n9.1.1 Apparent Magnitude\nEarly astronomers had to rely on the best equipment they could obtain — their own eyes. So, magnitudes were originally determined by how faint a star appeared in the sky. And, yes, Keppy, before you interrupt, it was a woefully subjective system, but it was all they had to work with. And Hippy, you’ll be interested to know that the system was formalized by your namesake, Hipparchus, along with Claudius Ptolemy, in the Second Century BCE.\nThe most visible (brightest) stars were given a (visual) magnitude of 1; magnitude 2 stars were dimmer than magnitude 1 stars, magnitude 3 dimmer still, and so on.. Magnitude 6 stars were those just barely bright enough to be seen with the naked eye.\n\nNote that this is based on ideal viewing conditions… dark sky, no full moon, no clouds, etc. - For modern people looking up under a suburban sky, the best they’re likely to be able to see is around magnitude 4.5 – 5 - City dwellers will be lucky to see stars of magnitude 3.\nIn fact, in 1994, the city of Los Angeles experienced a major power outage as a result of the Northridge earthquake. The lack of “light pollution” gave residents a view of the night sky they were unfamiliar with, which included the Milky Way (our own galaxy) glowing overhead. Observatories such as the one in Griffith Park, reported receiving calls from curious — and sometimes alarmed — residents, enquiring what the strange glowing cloud above was.\n\n\nHippy: Pfffft.\n\n\nNow, now, Hippy. You were fortunate to live in a time when dark meant dark. Very few moderns ever really experience true darkness for any significant amount of time, and are, in fact, quite unnerved by it.\n\nYou’ll notice that, astronomers being astronomers, these numbers also run “backward” — the higher the magnitude, the dimmer the star (or any object for that matter), so, yes, you will encounter negative magnitudes for those objects that are brighter than the brightest stars; the Full Moon, for instance has an apparent magnitude of -12.9 on this scale, and the planet, Venus, has an apparent magnitude of -4.7 at its brightest in Earth’s sky.\nLater astronomers — much later, in fact more than 2000 years later — made the system mathematical, on a logarithmic scale. This means that in the modern system, a magnitude 2 star is 2.512 times dimmer than a magnitude 1 star.\n\nKeppy: Why 2.512, for heaven’s sake?\n\nHow did I know you were going to ask that — and marvelous pun, by-the-way.\nWhen modern astronomer Norman Robert Pogson (1829 – 1891), decided to “mathematize” Hipparchus subjective scale, he didn’t want to rewrite literally thousands of years of astronomical documents to re-categorize stars, so, he had to stick with the 1 – 6 scale Hipparchus had established. This means that there’s a difference of \\(6 - 1 = 5\\) steps between the dimmest and the brightest stars.\nFortunately, by measurement, the brightness difference between first and sixth magnitude stars is about a factor of 100. So, 5 steps in magnitude = 100× in brightness; therefore the difference between each single step in the sequence is: \\[\nd = \\sqrt[5]{100} \\approx 2.5118864\n\\] … which is rounded to 2.512 for convenience. Practically speaking, one can simply remember that a magnitude 3 star is 2.5× brighter than a magnitude 4 star. ### Absolute Magnitude As with apparent brightness ([[Apparent Brightness ✓]]), however a star’s magnitude is dependent on its distance from the observer, and once it became clear to astronomers that different stars were different distances away, the question naturally arose: “How bright are they, really, then?”\n\n\n9.1.2 Vega, The ‘Standard Candle’\nThe star α-Lyrae, popularly known as Vega, acts as the standard candle for absolute magnitudes…..\n\nKeppy: Why Vega?\n\nI knew if I gave you the opening you’d dive right into it, so here goes….\n\nVega is one of the brightest stars visible to the naked eye from Earth (\\(m = 0.03\\))\nIt is almost directly overhead for mid-northern latitudes (where most of the “official”, mathematical astronomy was being done at the time), and it is visible for much of the year.\nVega’s brightness is remarkably steady compared to many other stars.\nA magnitude of \\(m = 0.03\\) is so close to 0 that it made sense to ground the scale at \\(m_{vega} = 0\\).\nOther stars were then calibrated to this “standard candle”. #### The Parallax Effect\nAstronomers measure nearby star distances by parallax — how much a star appears to shift against the background when Earth moves 1 AU (six months apart).\n\nIf a star shifts by 1 arcsecond, its distance is defined as 1 parsec (“parallax-second”).\n\nBy coincidence of geometry, 1 parsec ≈ 3.26 light years ≈ 206,265 AU.\n\n\nHippy: One arcsecond, by the way, is \\(\\frac{1}{3600}\\) of a degree on the sky, and 1 degree on the sky is about twice as large as the width of the Full Moon, so, it’s a very small displacement, indeed.\n\nCorrect! In fact an arcsecond is about 5 microns at arm’s length, or about \\(\\frac{1}{10} \\text{to} \\frac{1}{20}\\) the width of a human hair from that same distance. In other words, you’re not going to notice this just by looking — very precise instruments are needed to detect such small variations.\n\nKeppy: So how did early astronomers manage to measure such small variations?\n\nGreat question! Instead of using really precise instruments, they used really big ones. The sextant used by Prince Ulugh Beg (1394 – 1449 CE) in his observatory in Samarkand had a radius of about 40 meters (131’ 4”), allowing him to make stellar position measurements as fine as 20 arcseconds — a precision not matched for centuries after his time. His star catalog (Zīj-i Sultānī; “The Sultanic Tables”), finished in 1437 CE, listed the positions of ≈1000 stars with an accuracy better than 1 arcminute. It corrected many errors in the Almagest (Alexandria, c. 150 CE) of Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100 – 170 CE), which had been the standard tabulation for 1200 years. The precision of Ulugh Beg’s work was not equaled in the West until Tycho Brahe’s efforts in the late 16th century, and it was still a respected reference well into the 17th Century. ### Relating Distance to Parallax And this is where the distances to the stars comes back into the story. Apparent magnitude and Absolute Magnitude are related by a relationship called the distance modulus, mathematically expressed as: \\[\nm - M = 5\\;log_{10}(d) - 5\n\\] Where \\(d\\) is the distance to the star in parsecs. So, a star’s Absolute magnitude is how bright the star would appear to us if it were exactly 10 parsecs away. This is less straighforward than the simple inverse-square law that governs apparent brightness for local observers, and might not really be that useful for thesiasts, unless you’re wanting to know how bright your star would appear to someone looking at it from a significant distance away from your star system. ### Magnitude and Luminosity The general equation relating absolute magnitude (\\(M\\)) to stellar luminosity in stellar units is: \\[\nM = M_⊙ - 2.5\\; log_{10}(L)\n\\] Where: - \\(L\\) = the star’s luminosity in solar units.\nPlugging in the Sun’s absolute magnitude value \\(M=4.83\\): \\[\nM = 4.83 - 2.5\\; log_{10}(L)\n\\] … and rearranging: \\[\n4.83 = -2.5\\;log_{10}(C)\n\\] … and solving for C: \\[\nC = 10^{-\\frac{4.83}{2.5}} \\approx 0.01169\n\\] … and rearranging again: \\[\nM = -2.5\\;log_{10}(0.01169L)\n\\] Where: - \\(L\\) = the luminosity of the star in solar units.\n… the inverse of which is: \\[\nL = 85.5432 \\times 2.512^{-M}\n\\] Where: - \\(M\\) = the star’s absolute magnitude.\nThis gives us a rough approximation of any star’s absolute magnitude and we can use the distance modulus to calculate an apparent magnitude from that. ## Abstract Major Topics:\n- Apparent brightness (flux) as a function of luminosity and distance.\n- Absolute form: \\(B_A = \\dfrac{L_W}{4 \\pi d^2}\\):contentReferenceoaicite:0.\n- Relative form (solar units): \\(B_{A⊙} = \\dfrac{L}{D^2}\\):contentReferenceoaicite:1.\n- Inverse-square law for radiation intensity.\n- Worked examples: Sun as seen from Mars; star Kalveru (L = 1.618⊙) at 1 AU and 1.524 AU:contentReferenceoaicite:2.\nKey Terms & Symbols:\n- \\(B_A\\) = apparent brightness (flux, W/m²).\n- \\(L_W\\) = luminosity (watts).\n- \\(d\\) = distance (meters).\n- \\(B_{A⊙}\\) = apparent brightness in solar units.\n- \\(L\\) = luminosity in solar units.\n- \\(D\\) = distance in AU (semi-major axis).\nCross-Check Notes:\n- Canonical use: \\(B_{A⊙}\\) form is preferred for thesiastic accessibility.\n- Related to glossary entries: luminosity, flux, inverse-square law, semi-major axis (𝒜).\n- Examples provide concrete context (Mars orbit, Kalveru–Dynon system).\n- Ensure no collision with existing brightness/flux notation elsewhere.",

Symbolic Use\n- The term draws from Tellus, the Latin Earth-mother, but in this context is geostructural, not biological.\n- When contrasted with Xenotic, the distinction is about structure (rocky vs. exotic or gaseous), not life-hosting potential. ## Abstract\nMajor Topics:\n- Defines Xenotic planemons as worlds whose potential biospheres are non-Earthlike, supporting alien chemistries or life systems (non-carbonic, non-water-based, etc.).\n- Parameter envelope (relative to Earth units ⨁):\n- Mass: ⟨0.0001 ∧ 4131⟩\n- Density: ⟨0.01 ∧ 7.00⟩\n- Gravity: ⟨0.02 ∧ 60.00⟩\n- Radius: ⟨0.02 ∧ 11.00⟩\n- Escape velocity: ⟨0.02 ∧ 25.00⟩\n- Emphasis: Xenotic classification is not structural (unlike Telluric, Geotic, etc.), but biological, about what kinds of life might emerge.\n- Inclusions: ammonia/methane-based biospheres, silicon-based or plasma-phase life, deep high-pressure gas giant biota, crystalline metabolic substrates, etc.\n- Exclusions: simply being Geotic or Gaean does not make a world Xenotic.

The term is not tied to physical parameters, but to the biological strangeness of the world’s potential life-hosting capacity.\nCore Feature: - Xenotic classification is not about what the world is — it’s about what kind of life it might support.\n- A Xenotic world might be a rocky, icy, or gaseous body — but its biotic potential lies outside the realm of Earth-normal life. - This is an extremely broad classification: only 0.35% of planemons sharing Xenotic mass and density ranges qualify as Tellurics. Gaeans share mass and density range with only 0.001% of Xenotics. Key Principle: &gt; A world may fall entirely within Gaean or Geotic parameters and still be Xenotic in character — if its biosphere is chemically or structurally alien to terrestrial assumptions.\nInclusions: - Ammonia-based or methanogenic biospheres (e.g., Titan-like)\n- Silicon-based or plasma phase consciousness (hypothetical)\n- High-pressure deep-atmosphere lifeforms on gas giants\n- Ultra-dense crust-worlds with lattice-bonded metabolic substrates\n- Life emerging in conditions unreplicable on Earth Exclusions: - Gaean or Geotic worlds are not Xenotic simply by shape or size.\n- Xenotic worlds may physically overlap with all other categories — but their life potential diverges completely. Symbolic Use: - From Greek xenos (ξένος): “stranger,” “foreigner,” “outsider.”\n- Xenotic worlds are those where life is not just different — it is alien. Parameter Notes: - Mass (⨁): from sublunar pebbles to brown dwarf threshold.\n- Density (⨁): from hydrogen-ice slushes to ultra dense crystal-metallic cores.\n- Gravity (⨁): ~0.02⨁ (Mars-like) up to ~60⨁ (felt at inner gas dwarf surfaces). - Spans everything from fragile ultralow-gravity cometary clumps to neutronium-crusted compact objects just short of degeneracy collapse. - This definition also accommodates highly stratified gas layers (e.g. floatable biospheres in Saturnian-class or puffy hot-Neptune exotics). - Any values beyond this envelope cross into ulsic or hypotheticals: black holes, quark matter, etc. - Radius (⨁): up to 11⨁ to accommodate inflation-limited gas giants and Super-Jupiters. - Frequently exceeded by puffy planemons due to close proximity to their stars inflating their atmospheres. - Escape Velocity (⨁): capped at 25⨁ ≈ 280 km/s, brushing the domain of hot-start brown dwarfs.\n\nThese are not bound by Earth-normal biology. They simply represent physically plausible, self-cohering planemon-scale entities where exotic life — as chemistry permits — might arise. ## Abstract\nMajor Topics:\n- Summarizes the external concept of “superhabitable planemons” (Heller & Armstrong, 2014), proposed as worlds more conducive to diverse biospheres than Earth.\n- Criteria include:\n- Stellar hosts: spectral classes M0–G9, masses ⟨0.359 ∧ 0.817⨀⟩, lifetimes ≥ 3 Ga.\n- planemon properties:\n- Mass: ⟨2.0 ∧ 3.0⨁⟩ (optimum ≈ 2.0⨁).\n- Radius: ⟨1.260 ∧ 1.442⨁⟩ (Earthlike density/gravitation).\n- Strong tectonics, carbon–silicate cycling, thicker atmosphere, stronger magnetic shielding.\n- Flatter surface, shallower oceans with ~71% global coverage.\n- Mean temperature ≈ 25 °C; O₂ concentration &gt; 20.95%.\n- Orbits near the center of the host star’s habitable zone.\n- Scientific rationale: slightly more massive than Earth → longer tectonic/geological cycling, better climate stabilization, stronger magnetic protection, smoother surface conditions.\n- Supported by Noack & Breuer (2011) on tectonic propensity in 1–5 M⊕ range.\n\nRelation to WCB Canon:\n- WCB does not use the term “superhabitable.”\n- Instead, these criteria are encompassed within Rheatic planemons, which refine the same concept for WCB internal classifications.\n- External term is acknowledged for context but not adopted into lexicon.\nKey Terms & Symbols:\n- Superhabitable [exo]: external concept (Heller & Armstrong, 2014).\n- Rheatic planemons [neo]: WCB equivalent classification.\n- Carbon–Silicate Cycle [sci].\nCross-Check Notes:\n- Rheatic planemons are already part of WCB classification.\n- “Superhabitable” remains external-only, acknowledged but not canonized.\n- Status: [EXPANDED + EXO] — expands habitability framework with external criteria; adopts internal Rheatic equivalent.",

    "text": "14.2 Superhabitables and Mass: Beyond “Just Right”\nIn 2014, René Heller and John Armstrong proposed the existence of superhabitable planemons — worlds that may be more conducive to life than Earth, even if not ideal for humans. These planemons are theorized to exceed Earth’s habitability not by matching its parameters exactly, but by surpassing them in specific, life-favoring ways. ### 📌 Definition:\n\nA superhabitable world is one that provides enhanced conditions for the emergence, proliferation, and persistence of life — especially diverse, adaptive, and long-lasting biospheres.\nIn Worldcrafting 101 terms, these may be considered mega-ontosomic worlds: not only capable of supporting life, but actively better at nurturing it.\n\n\n14.2.0.1 🔸 Key Mass-Linked Traits of Superhabitables\n\nAccording to Heller & Armstrong, ideal superhabitable worlds are:\n\nSlightly more massive than Earth, typically ⟨1.200 ∧ 2.000⟩ ⨁, with upper candidates up to 3.000 ⨁\n\nGeologically more persistent: higher mass leads to longer tectonic lifespans\n\nThermally buffered: more efficient retention of internal heat extends mantle convection and volcanism\n\nBetter magnetic shielding: large, slowly cooling cores sustain stronger and longer-lived magnetospheres\n\nLarger surface area: more room for ecological diversification, especially with flatter terrain\n\nThicker atmospheres: improved radiation shielding, more stable greenhouse effect\n\nMore shallow seas: potentially broader tidal zones and nutrient-rich photic environments\n\nImplications\n\nMass increases above ~1.500 ⨁ usually signal rising risk, particularly for Earthlike surface biology. But for generalized ontosomic potential, the picture is more nuanced.\nA world with 1.600–2.000⨁ mass and moderate density ⟨0.800 ∧ 1.100⟩⨁ may maintain:\n\nSurface gravity in the ≈ ⟨1.200 ∧ 1.400⟩⨁ range (still viable)\nEscape velocity high enough to retain a thick but breathable atmosphere\nInternal heat sufficient to power tectonics for billions of years\n\n\nTradeoffs\n\nSuperhabitability does not mean superhuman-friendliness:\n\nBiomechanical costs rise as gravity increases\n\nSpace access becomes difficult (high vₑ​)\n\nPhotosynthetically active radiation may differ under cooler stars\n\nDense, moist atmospheres may favor different metabolisms and chemistries\n\nThese are worlds where life flourishes, but not necessarily your life.\n\n**Superhabitables are not exceptions to the Geotic envelope\n\nThey are edge-pushing optimals within a carefully constrained corner of it**:\n\nMass: ⟨1.200 ∧ 2.000⟩ ⨁\nDensity: ⟨0.800 ∧ 1.100⟩ ⨁\nGravity: ⟨1.100 ∧ 1.400⟩ ⨁\nTectonics: Active over 5+ Gyr\nMagnetosphere: Sustained by large convective iron core\nStar: Spectral class M0–G9 (mass ∈ ⟨0.359 ∧ 0.817⟩ ☉)\n\n\nSuperhabitables challenge anthropocentric bias\n\nThey show that habitability isn’t a peak — it’s a plateau\nMass above 1.500⨁ doesn’t always push you into hazard space; under the right conditions, it creates biological opportunity. In such cases, higher mass may be not a warning sign — but an invitation.",

Over billions of years, this is how Earth built up its continents.\n\n\n\n18.7.4 🧓 Why Some Rocks Are 3.7 Billion Years Old\nThose ancient rocks in Scotland, Greenland, Australia, and Canada are part of what we call cratons — old, stable cores of continental lithosphere that have: - Survived every tectonic rearrangement\n- Resisted subduction due to buoyancy\n- Avoided recycling into the mantle\n- Often remained above sea level or **only shallowly\nThese regions include formations like: - The Isua Greenstone Belt in Greenland\n- The Jack Hills zircon deposits in Australia\n- The Lewisian complex in Scotland\nThey are made of felsic or ultra-felsic rocks, like granite and gneiss, and represent:\n\nThe surviving scaffolding of Earth’s first continents.\n\n\n\n18.7.5 🧭 :\n\nOceanic crust is temporary — it’s made, spread, and subducted like conveyor belt parts.\n\nContinental crust is archival — it builds up over time, preserves history, and keeps records. So a 3.7-billion-year-old rock is a literal relic of the early Earth, untouched by recycling, uplifted by tectonics, and never drowned or subducted deep enough to erase its story.\n\n\n🔍 If your world has ancient exposed felsic terranes, it implies: - Very old crust (from early tectonic activity)\n- Long-term tectonic stability\n- Minimal subduction or high rates of crustal buoyancy\n- Possibly low sea level or uplifted interiors",

If the orbit is short in duration, these fluctuations might be experienced more as something like seasonal changes, whereas if the orbit is of long duration, they might be more climatological shifts over a span of years, or even centuries or millennia.\nIn the case of high orbital eccentricity, the apparent size of the star in the sky might become naked-eye noticeable.",

It avoids complex spherical trigonometry by using sky maps and focuses on qualitative visualization.\nWhen considering ring shadows on a terrestrial planet, the exact math quickly becomes too complex for this guide. However, you can approximate the effect using a sky-map method:\n\nChoose observer latitude (()):\n\nFor that latitude, the ring arcs (inner and outer edges) are constant in the sky. They do not change with season.\n\nPlot the ring:\n\nDraw the inner and outer arcs of the ring plane on a flattened sky chart (altitude vs. azimuth).\n\nPlot the Sun’s path for the day:\n\nThe Sun’s diurnal arc depends on its declination (()) for that day in the apical chronum.\n\nThis sets its rising/setting azimems and maximum noon altitude.\n\nLook for intersections:\n\nWhere the Sun’s path crosses the inner/outer ring arcs = entry/exit points into ring shadow.\n\nEstimate time in shadow:\n\nThe horizontal (azimuthal) component of these intersection points tells you what fraction of the diurn the Sun spends behind the rings.\n\nThe vertical (altitude) component confirms whether the Sun actually overlaps the ring band at all.\n\n\nKey Insight:\n- Ring placement/width = fixed for a given latitude.\n- Sun’s path = variable with declination.\n- Shadow events = when/where those two systems overlap.\nThis gives a practical, diagram-based way to visualize daily ring shadow effects without diving into spherical trig.\n\n\n16.2.2 Ring Shadow Scenarios\nHere we outline the possible daily patterns of ring-shadow events (none, partial, double crossing, special equator–equinox case). These scenarios are the observable outcomes of the Quick Method.\nThe following scenarios illustrate how the Sun’s path and the fixed ring arcs can interact, producing different shadowing outcomes through the day:\n\nNo Occlusion\n\nThe Sun’s daily path lies entirely outside the ring band.\n\nThe Sun rises and sets south (or north) of the rings and never passes behind them.\n\nPartial Occlusion\n\nThe Sun’s path intersects the ring band once.\n\nThe Sun rises outside the rings, passes behind them for part of the day, then emerges before setting.\n\nDouble Crossing\n\nThe Sun’s path passes through the ring band twice.\n\nThe Sun rises outside the rings, passes behind them, emerges above them near noon, and then passes behind again before setting.\n\nNever Entirely Occluded\n\nBecause the ring arcs converge to points at east and west horizons, the Sun always begins and ends the day outside the rings.\n\nThus, the Sun cannot be fully hidden for the entire diurn under normal circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n16.2.3 Special Case: Equator at Equinox\n\nAt the planetary equator during equinoxes, the Sun’s path coincides with the ring plane.\n\nThe Sun rises due east, passes overhead at zenith, and sets due west along the same great circle as the rings.\n\nIn this alignment, the Sun is “behind” the ring plane all day.\n\nHowever, since the rings have a much narrower angular width on the sky than the Sun’s disc, the effect is negligible: no significant dimming or shadowing would be seen by surface observers.\n\n\n\n16.2.4 Ring Shadow Climate Effects\nDense or opaque rings can noticeably reduce insolation at the surface. This section considers how such shading might alter daily temperatures, weather cycles, and even settlement patterns, without attempting full climate modeling.\nWhere rings are dense enough, these shadow scenarios can affect not just what the sky looks like, but also how much solar energy reaches the ground. If a planetary ring is dense or optically thick, its shadow can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the surface whenever the Sun passes behind it. The severity of the effect depends on how much of the Sun’s disc is obscured and for how long.\n\n16.2.4.1 At the Subsolar Point\n\nShadowing is most direct when the Sun is highest in the sky.\n\nSignificant daily shading here could:\n\nLower peak surface temperatures.\n\nDelay or reduce convection cycles (e.g., thunderstorm formation, monsoon timing).\n\nAlter evaporation rates and precipitation.\n\n\n\n\n16.2.4.2 Seasonal & Locational Consequences\n\nThe Sun’s path shifts with the apical chronum (season).\n\nSome regions may experience daily shading during summer, providing relief from heat.\n\nOther regions may be unshaded in winter when the Sun’s path lies outside the ring band.\n\nHigher latitudes may see the shadow zone migrate poleward or equatorward with the seasons.\n\n\n\n16.2.4.3 Life-Saving Respite\nIn especially hot climates, rings could act as natural parasols.\n- Example: A city in a desert belt might be survivable only because, during the hottest months, the Sun passes behind the rings from late morning until early afternoon each day.\n- Such shading could literally determine where civilizations thrive.\n\n\n16.2.4.4 Complexity Warning\nModeling this rigorously requires:\n- Optical depth of the rings.\n- Fraction of the Sun’s disc blocked during occultation.\n- Duration of shadow events.\n- Seasonal variation of these durations.\n- Climate feedback (albedo, heat storage, cloud dynamics).\nThis is well beyond the scope of this guide. For worldbuilding purposes, simply note:\n\nRings can alter daily and seasonal insolation patterns, sometimes dramatically.\nAuthors may invoke rings as life-saving parasols, or as sources of seasonal hardship.\n\n\n\n\n16.2.5 Timing Behavior of Ring Shadows\nRing-shadow events happen at predictable times of day that drift seasonally. This section explains how those timings remain stable near solstices and shift quickly near equinoxes, echoing the familiar pattern of sunrise and sunset changes.\nThe qualitative outcomes above happen at specific times of day. These timings drift in a predictable seasonal pattern as the Sun’s declination changes:\n\nThe ring arcs are fixed in the sky for any given latitude.\n\nThe Sun’s path shifts gradually with the apical chronum (season), so the entry/exit times of shadow events drift over the year.\n\nSeasonal Pattern:\n- Near solstices: Declination changes slowly → shadow timings remain nearly constant, varying by only a minute or two over several weeks.\n- Near equinoxes: Declination changes rapidly → shadow timings shift more noticeably, sometimes by several minutes per day.\nThis mirrors the familiar seasonal drift of sunrise and sunset times.\n\n\n16.2.6 Reality Check\nHere we step back to emphasize limits. While ring shadows can be imagined, described, and even mapped in principle, exact calculations require advanced modeling. This guide provides qualitative tools and approximations for worldbuilding, not rigorous orbital climatology.\nRing shadows are:\n- Imaginable → the geometry can be pictured.\n- Describable → qualitative scenarios (no shadow, partial shadow, double crossing, equator–equinox exception) are clear.\n- Theoretically mappable → with spherical trig and patience, one could chart exact entry/exit times for any latitude, date, and ring geometry.\nBut this is not back-of-the-envelope work.\n- It is not coffee-break math.\n- It requires dedicated modeling (great-circle geometry + spherical trigonometry + seasonal solar motion).\nWorldbuilding takeaway:\nUse the qualitative scenarios and the Quick Method approximation for storytelling. Exact computations belong to advanced orbital mechanics or climate modeling, not casual reference.",

Advice\nWhen using the sinusoidal method, you have two options:\n\nAccept the values as returned.\n\nThis keeps the math simple and transparent.\n\nThe approximation will always add up to the correct year length (\\(C\\)).\n\nErrors are usually small if \\(e ≤ 0.1\\) (a few diurns at most for Earth-like orbits).\n\nApply the generalized fudge factor.\n\nTo break the “paired seasons” pattern and create four distinct values, redistribute part of the correction term.\n\nUse the rule: \\[\nf = 10e\n\\]\n\n\n\nSubtract \\(f \\times \\left(\\tfrac{2e}{\\pi}C\\right)\\) from the long seasons (those with \\(\\sin\\nu = +1\\)).\n\nAdd the same amount to the short seasons (those with \\(\\sin\\nu = -1\\)).\n\nBaseline seasons (where \\(\\sin\\nu = 0\\)) remain unchanged.\n\nWhy this works:\n- The fudge stays tied to orbital eccentricity, so it scales correctly for different worlds.\n- The method remains SANC — Simple, Approximate, Notationally Clear — while avoiding arbitrary “just make something up” adjustments.\n📖 WCB Note:\nThe sinusoidal shortcut is SANC — Simple, Approximate, Notationally Clear. It always gives you a consistent set of season lengths that add to the right year. If you’re working with a mildly eccentric orbit (\\(e \\lesssim 0.03\\)), you may want to apply the fudge factor \\(f=10e\\) to nudge the values closer to reality and give you four distinct seasons. If you’re working with a strongly eccentric orbit, leave the fudge aside — the uneven seasons it predicts are already the truth of the geometry. Ultimately, whether you ‘fudge’ is up to you as the worldbuilder: do you want clean numbers, or do you want raw extremes? Both choices are defensible.\n\n14.1.0.1 Worked Example: Rosetta (Sinusoidal Approximation, Sidereal Chronum)\nGiven:\n- \\(\\phi = 180^\\circ\\)\n- \\(C = 492\\) diurns (sidereal chronum)\n- \\(e = 0.05\\)\nStep 1 — Baseline \\[\n\\frac{C}{4} = \\frac{492}{4} = 123.0\n\\] Step 2 — Correction Factor \\[\n\\frac{2e}{\\pi} C = \\frac{2 \\times 0.05}{\\pi} \\times 492 = 15.66\n\\] Step 3 — Seasonal Adjustments (Rosetta) True anomalies from \\(\\phi = 180^\\circ\\): \\[\n\\nu = (\\phi + 90n) \\bmod 360\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{rlll}\nn = 0 & \\nu = 0^\\circ   & & \\text{spring equinox} \\\\\nn = 1 & \\nu = 90^\\circ  & & \\text{summer solstice} \\\\\nn = 2 & \\nu = 180^\\circ & & \\text{autumn equinox} \\\\\nn = 3 & \\nu = 270^\\circ & & \\text{winter solstice}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nStep 4 — Apply the Formula \\[\n\\Delta t \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{C}{4} + \\left(\\frac{2e}{\\pi} C \\times \\sin\\nu\\right)\n\\begin{cases}\nn=0;\\;\\nu=0^\\circ;\\;\\sin\\nu=-1 & \\Delta t_\\text{spring} \\approx 123.0 - 15.66 = 107.3 \\\\\nn=1;\\;\\nu=90^\\circ;\\;\\sin\\nu=0 & \\Delta t_\\text{summer} \\approx 123.0 \\\\\nn=2;\\;\\nu=180^\\circ;\\;\\sin\\nu=1 & \\Delta t_\\text{autumn} \\approx 123.0 + 15.66 = 138.7 \\\\\nn=3;\\;\\nu=270^\\circ;\\;\\sin\\nu=0 & \\Delta t_\\text{winter} \\approx 123.0 \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\] Result:\n- Spring ≈ 107.3 diurns\n- Summer ≈ 123.0 diurns\n- Autumn ≈ 138.7 diurns\n- Winter ≈ 123.0 diurns (Total = 492 diurns)\nConclusion The sinusoidal approximation predicts for Rosetta: - Two baseline seasons (winter, summer ≈ 123 diurns)\n- One shorter season (spring ≈ 107 diurns)\n- One longer season (autumn ≈ 139 diurns) - The difference between the longest and shortest seasons is over 31 diurns — nearly a whole “weke” longer or shorter than the baseline! - This is much more dramatic than Earth’s ±2–3 day distortions, because Rosetta’s orbital eccentricity (\\(e=0.05\\)) is about 3× larger than Earth’s. Advice - You can accept these values directly, which already tell the story of a planet with noticeably uneven seasons.\n- Or you can tweak them slightly (redistributing a fraction of the correction term) to break the symmetry of the paired seasons and produce four distinct values, closer to what the Kepler method would return.\n- Either way, the results remain SANC — Simple, Approximate, Notationally Clear — while giving Rosettan cultures a real seasonal asymmetry to reckon with.",

    "text": "14.2 2. Kepler’s Exact Method (Eccentric Anomaly Conversion)\nThis more precise method uses full orbital geometry to derive season lengths. Key features:\n- Produces true season lengths, including asymmetries between all four.\n- If periastron lines up with a solstice or equinox, still produces pairs (but corrected vs. sinusoidal).\n- If periastron is offset, yields four distinct season lengths (like Earth’s 93/94/90/89-day split).\n- Requires a calculator, but no iteration — just arctan and sin. ### Step 1 — Choose True Anomalies Pick the true anomalies (\\(\\nu\\)) for the four seasonal markers, offset by obliquity azimuth \\(\\phi\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\nu = (\\phi + 90n) \\bmod 360 \\\\[1em]\n&\\begin{cases}\nn = 0; \\;\\text{spring equinox} \\\\\nn = 1; \\;\\text{summer solstice} \\\\\nn = 2; \\;\\text{autumn equinox} \\\\\nn = 3; \\;\\text{winter solstice} \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] ### Step 2 — Convert to Eccentric Anomaly For each \\(\\nu\\), compute the eccentric anomaly \\(E\\): \\[\nE = 2 \\arctan \\!\\left( \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1-e}{1+e}} \\;\\tan \\dfrac{\\nu}{2} \\right)\n\\] ### Step 3 — Convert to Mean Anomaly Translate \\(E\\) into mean anomaly \\(M\\), which grows linearly with time: \\[\nM = E -

The Kepler method reproduces Earth’s observed seasons within half a day per season.\n- It captures the correct pattern — two longer seasons and two shorter — without needing any fudge factors.\n\n\n14.2.1.2 Worked Example: Rosetta (Kepler’s Method, Sidereal Chronum)\nGiven:\n- \\(\\phi = 180^\\circ\\)\n- \\(C = 492\\) diurns (sidereal chronum)\n- \\(e = 0.05\\)\nStep 1 — True Anomalies Seasonal markers from \\(\\phi = 180^\\circ\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nu &= (\\phi + 90n) \\bmod 360 \\\\[1em]\n&\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{rlll}\nn = 0 & \\nu = 0^\\circ   & & \\text{spring equinox} \\\\\nn = 1 & \\nu = 90^\\circ  & & \\text{summer solstice} \\\\\nn = 2 & \\nu = 180^\\circ & & \\text{autumn equinox} \\\\\nn = 3 & \\nu = 270^\\circ & & \\text{winter solstice}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nStep 2 — Convert to Eccentric Anomaly \\[\nE = 2 \\arctan \\!\\left( \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1-e}{1+e}} \\;\\tan \\tfrac{\\nu}{2} \\right)\n\\] Step 3 — Convert to Mean Anomaly \\[\nM = E -

In practice, some frameworks may assign \\(\\chi = 0\\) for bookkeeping, but this has no physical meaning.",

    "section": "18.1 More About Scale Height",
    "text": "18.1 More About Scale Height\nAs related above, atmospheric scale height (H) - Governs pressure drop with altitude - Affects breathing, mountain height, and high-altitude flight\nHowever, the value of H varies with the composition of the atmosphere because the molecular mass is different for each component gas and is not a constant.\n\nHippy: You need to calculate H based on how much O₂, buffer gas, etc. your atmosphere has.\n\nExactly! So, how do you do that?\n\n18.1.1 Calculating Scale Height\nScale height (H) depends on: - T = average temperature of the atmosphere (in Kelvin)\n- M = mean molar mass of the gas mixture (in kg/mol)\n- g = surface gravity (in m/s²)\n- R = universal gas constant ≈ 8.314 J/mol·K\n… related in the equation: \\[\nH = \\dfrac{R T}{M g}\n\\] #### First\nFind the mean molecular (molar) mass M. Each gas in the atmosphere contributes to the average molar mass based on its mole fraction: \\[\nM = \\sum{x_i M_i}\n\\] &gt; Keppy: DON’T PANIC! That Σ might look like calculus, but it’s not… all it’s saying is that we sum up the molar masses of all the gasses present\nYes, in the above equation: - \\(x_i\\) is the mole fraction of each atmospheric gas (in Earth’s case, that’s 0.78 for N₂; 0.21 for O₂) - \\(M_i\\) is the molar mass of the gas in question.\nLet’s use Earth’s atmosphere as an example: - Atmosphere = 78% N₂, 21% O₂, 1% Ar (using kg/mol):\n- \\(M_{N_2} = 0.028014\\)\n- \\(M_{O_2} = 0.031998\\) - \\(M_{Ar} = 0.039948\\) - We lump argon in with the trace gasses in Earth’s case \\[\nM = (0.78 \\times 0.028014) + (0.21 \\times 0.031998) + (0.01 \\times 0.039948) = 0.02896 \\text{ kg/mol}​\n\\]\n\nKeppy: Where did 0.028014, and the other numbers come from?\n\nWell spotted!\nEach gas has a known molar mass — the mass of one mole of its molecules — and it’s typically expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). Since we’re working in SI units, we convert those to kilograms per mole (kg/mol) by dividing by 1000. And we look those numbers up in an appropriate (and reliable) source. Here are a few for reference:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas\nChemical Formula\nMolar Mass (g/mol)\nMolar Mass (kg/mol)\n\n\n\n\nNitrogen\nN₂\n28.014\n0.028014\n\n\nOxygen\nO₂\n31.998\n0.031998\n\n\nArgon\nAr\n39.948\n0.039948\n\n\nCarbon Dioxide\nCO₂\n44.01\n0.044010\n\n\nWater vapor\nH₂O (gas)\n18.015\n0.018015\n\n\nMethane\nCH₄\n16.043\n0.016043\n\n\nHelium\nHe\n4.003\n0.004003\n\n\n\n\nHippy: And you use these values in your atmosphere recipe to get your average molar mass.\n\nExactly! Once you’ve built your mix — say, 75% N₂ and 25% O₂ — just multiply each molar mass by its fraction and sum the results.\n\nKeppy: Seems like that equation could get lengthy and complex.\n\nYou are not wrong about that. Getting warm and friendly with a spreadsheet or a programmable calculator is very good advice for the serious worldcrafter, for sure.\n\n18.1.1.1 Second\nNow that we have our value for M, we plug it into our other known values for R (8.314), T (288), and g (9.8) and get: \\[\nH=\\dfrac{R T}{M g} = \\dfrac{8.314 \\times 288}{0.02896 \\times 9.8} = \\dfrac{2395.6}{0.2838} = 8.44\\text{ km},\n\\]\n… which is usually rounded up to H = 8.5 km for convenience, but you can use the more exact value if you prefer.\n\nHippy: T = 288 K is for Earth. How does one determine it for a ’crafted planemon?\n\nAh — excellent question.\nThe average surface temperature T depends on factors like: - The luminosity and spectral class of the central star(s)\n- The orbital distance of the planemon\n- The planemon’s albedo (reflectivity)\n- And any greenhouse effects caused by atmospheric composition\nThat starts to pull us into stellar physics and orbital modeling, which is covered in:\n\n🔗 Module XY.Z — Building Your Star and Setting Your Orbit\n\nThere, you’ll find methods for estimating a planemon’s equilibrium temperature and adjusting it for greenhouse gases to get a realistic T for your atmosphere model.\nFor now, if you’re working with a roughly Earthlike setup, using: \\[\nT ∈ \\langle260 \\wedge 320\\rangle K,\n\\] or roughly ⟨-13° ∧ 47°⟩C will keep your numbers in a plausible range.\nHere’s some context for that range:\n\n\n260K (-13°C; 8.6°F)\n\nClose to the freezing point of seawater\nSustained habitability without deep-cold adaptation is still possible\n\n273K (0°C; 32°F)\n\nFreezing point of water\nImportant psychological and ecological threshold\n\n288K (15°C; 59°F)\n\nEarth’s average\nServes as benchmark for climate comfort and live-rich biomes\n\n310K (37°C; 98.6°F)\n\nHuman core temperature\nUpper limit for comfort under heavy exertion\n\n320K (47°C; 116.6°F)\n\nAt or above this, heat stress becomes deadly without rapid evaporative cooling or climate control.\n\n\n\n\n❗️ Important note: IF you choose a surface temperature for your world, be sure to note it down, because it will help determine your star’s parameters later!\n\n\nKeppy: So, back to atmospheric composition: If you used argon instead of nitrogen as your buffer gas, the air would be heavier and H would shrink?\n\nExactly. More mass = more gravity per mole = thinner vertical spread = smaller H.\n\nKeppy: And in this case, we’re just ignoring the trace gasses altogether?\n\nMostly, yes — and here’s why:\nTrace gases like CO₂, CH₄, and H₂O vapor are typically present in such small quantities (fractions of a percent) that they barely shift the weighted average of molar mass.\nLet’s say your atmosphere is: - 78% N₂ (0.028014 kg/mol)\n- 21% O₂ (0.031998 kg/mol)\n- 1% CO₂ (0.04401 kg/mol)\n\\[\nM = (0.78 \\times 0.028014) + (0.21 \\times 0.031998) + (0.01 \\times 0.04401) = 0.02899 \\text{ kg/mol}​\n\\]\nThat’s a difference of only +0.00003 compared to Earth-normal — Less than a tenth of a percent. So, unless you’re at CO₂ levels high enough to make the air toxic or unbreathable, it’s safe to treat the trace gasses as negligible in the H calculation.\n\nHippy: So just include the big players — buffer gas and oxygen — and don’t sweat the tenths of a percent?\n\nBingo. You can always do a full weighted sum if you really want to be precise, but for 99% of cases, O₂ and the buffer gas dominate the molar mass for Geotic worlds.\n\n\n18.1.1.2 Third: Pressure vs. Altitude Approximation\nFor Earth: \\[\nP(h) = P_0 \\times 0.37^{\\frac{h}{H}}\n\\]\nWhere: - h = altitude in kilometers - H = 8.5 (or 8.44) km\n\nKeppy: What is P₀, and how do we know its value?\n\nPrecisely the question I’d ask at this point!\nP₀​ is the surface pressure of the planemon — that is, the pressure at zero altitude. On Earth, that value is defined as: - 1 atm - 101325 Pa* - 101.325 kPa\n* Named for Blaise Pascal; there’s not space here to go into this in detail, but it’s a fascinating read if you want to look it up!\nFor any world you create, P₀​ is one of your starting parameters. You either: - Choose it (e.g., 1.2 atm, or 0.65 atm), or\n- Derive it from known gas composition, temperature, and gravity (which gets more advanced)\nSo, let’s say you’ve chosen P₀ = 0.9 atm for your planemon, then at one scale height above the planemon’s surface, the atmospheric pressure calculates to: \\[\nP(H) = 0.9 \\times 0.37 = 0.333\\text{ atm}\n\\] &gt; Hippy: Which raises the question of where 0.37 comes from?\nExcellent question. That 0.37 isn’t arbitrary — it’s actually derived from a fundamental mathematical constant: Euler’s number, e (≈ 2.71828).\nThe pressure–altitude relationship is an exponential decay equation. In its most general form: \\[\nP(h) = P_0 \\times e^{\\frac{-h}{H}}\n\\] … which means that at an altitude of exactly one scale height (where h = H): \\[\nP(H) = P_0 \\times e^{-1} = P_0 \\times 0.3679\n\\] &gt; Keppy: Ah! I see… and P₀ is just whatever multiple of Earth’s surface pressure in atm you’ve chosen for your world!\n\nHippy: I always frown at “chosen”; is there any way to at least approximate an appropriate P₀ for your planemon based on how you decided to compose its atmosphere?\n\nWell…. yes…. sort of.\nYou can approximate P0P_0P0​ from first principles — and it’s especially useful if you’ve already defined your atmosphere’s: - Gas composition (molar mix)\n- Surface gravity (g)\n- Average temperature (T)\n… and rearranging the ideal gas law for planemon atmospheres: \\[\nP_0 = \\dfrac{\\rho R T}{M}\n\\] But this requires knowing ρ, the near-surface air density — which in turn depends on pressure and composition, so we go a different route.\nInstead, for an atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium, you can approximate: \\[\nP_0 ≈ \\dfrac{g M N}{A}\n\\] Where: - g = surface gravity - M = average molar mass (kg/mol) - N = total moles of atmosphere - A = surface area of the planemon\nBut this, too, gets messy without knowing how much gas the planemon started with, which is based on accretion, outgassing, escape velocity, etc.\nSo while you can try to derive it from theory — and I can help you do that — you’re usually safe choosing a P0P_0P0​ based on: - Your world’s gravity (g) - Its escape velocity (vₑ) - Its molar mass and buffer gas makeup (M – which we learned how to calculate above.)\nHere’s a “pressure plausibility chart” based on gravity and atmosphere type to give you an other “rule of thumb” to work from:\n\n\n\n18.1.2 🌍 Pressure Plausibility Chart\nRule-of-thumb surface pressures based on gravity and buffer gas makeup (M)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGravity(g in g⨁)\nLikely PressureRange (atm)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n⟨0.2 ∧ 0.6⟩\nLight gravity;thinner atmosphere unlessretained via cold temps or high mass gas\n\n\n0.75\n⟨0.4 ∧ 0.9⟩\nOn the thin side but potentiallybreathable; requires attention to O₂ %\n\n\n1.0\n⟨0.8 ∧ 1.2⟩\nEarth-normal, depending onmix of gases and water vapor\n\n\n1.25\n⟨1.0 ∧ 1.5⟩\nDenser air; easier to retainlight gases like H₂O, CH₄\n\n\n1.5\n⟨1.2 ∧ 2.0⟩\nHeavy air; pressure at sea levelcould approach adaptation limits\n\n\n\nThis assumes (!) an Earth-like atmosphere: - Mean molar mass ≈ ⟨0.028 ∧ 0.032⟩ kg/mol - Normal temperature (~288 K) - Terrestrial radius (~1⨁)\nYou’ll need to shift values worlds with high CO₂, significant greenhouse buildup, or non-volatile-rich origins, but the above should be well within bounds for Geotic worlds.",

If one body’s orbit is an exact integer value different from the other’s, the two are said to be in mean motion resonance, and the ratio of their orbits is a : b, denoted as the longer orbital period followed by the shorter orbital period, separated by a colon (∶).\n![[MeanMotionResonance2-1.jpg]]\nFor example, in the figure above, Body 1 orbits twice for every one orbit of Body 2. This is a first order resonance, because the difference between the two values is only 1 unit: \\[\n2 - 1 = 1\n\\] Other examples of first-order resonances1 would be 6 : 5, 13 : 12, etc.\nExamples of a second-order resonance would be those in which the orbital periods were separated by a difference of 2; e.g. 3 : 1 or 5 : 3. The higher the order of the resonance, the less stable the orbits will be over time.\nMean motion resonances can arise between three or more bodies. Jupiter’s moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede experience a 4 : 2 : 1 mean motion resonance between them, such that for every orbit Ganymede makes, Europa completes two, and Io completes four. This also means that Io orbits twice per each orbit of Europa.\nHowever, an interesting phenomenon also occurs, such that Ganymede, Europa, and Io never line up on the same side of Jupiter. Any two of them may line up at various points in their orbital dance, but all three never do.",

    "text": "15.2 The Synodian: Non-Integer Resonances\nWhen two bodies orbit a central body, but their orbital periods are: 1. not integer multiples of the system’s base time unit T; and, 2. not directly commensurate2 with one another, … a more sophisticated approach is required to calculate periodic alignments of the system.\nThe base time unit (\\(T\\)), may be years, months, days, even hours or minutes.\nThe interval between such instances of alignment is called the synodic period; here, we’ll refer to it as a synodion \\(\\Sigma\\) (pl: synodia), for reasons which will become clear presently. The moment of alignment, when the two orbitons are closest to one another, we call a synodos (pl: synodoi).\nThus, the synodion represents the time it takes for the two orbitons to return to the same relative configuration, such as having their centers fall on a line that includes the center of the central body. While synodia are still predictable, their periodicity is less intuitive that in mean motion resonance systems, requiring more precise calculations.\nThe best way to grasp these concepts is by working through an example. By appling the rules of synodic periods to a specific pair of orbiting bodies, we can illustrate how to calculate a synodion, and explore the patterns it reveals.\n\n15.2.1 A Worked Example\nLet’s imagine a system of three bodies, the central body (centron \\(\\dot{C}\\)) and two less massive bodies orbiting it (the orbitons \\(M_\\alpha\\) and \\(M_\\beta\\)). \\(M_\\alpha\\) has the longer orbital period (\\(P_\\alpha\\); the time it takes \\(M_\\alpha\\) to orbit the centron) and \\(M_\\beta\\) has the shorter orbital period (\\(P_\\beta\\); the time it takes \\(M_\\beta\\) to orbit the centron).\n\nWhile the masses of the bodies have no bearing on the following equations, they do matter from a nomenclature perspective. The more massive body is always the primary, the second-most massive body is the secondary; the third most is the tertiary, etc. Their radii are not a factor in determining their hierarchy. For instance, Mercury is more massive than Ganymede, but Ganymede has a larger radius. If the two of them were to form a two-body system, Ganymede would orbit Mercury, even though it is larger in radius and volume than Mercury.\n\nFor this example, we will define: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP_\\alpha = 24.36\\; \\text{days} \\\\\nP_\\beta = 11.72\\; \\text{days}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] ![[synodion01.jpg|300]] The above figure illustrates the starting configuration of our system (\\(T_0\\)). The starting angle at which all three bodies are lined up we call the base angle, denoted by \\(B^\\theta\\).\nWe can already make some determinations about our system: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP_\\delta = P_\\alpha - P_\\beta = 24.36 - 11.72 = 12.64\\; \\text{days} \\\\\nP_Q = \\dfrac{P_\\beta}{P_\\alpha} = \\dfrac{11.72}{24.36} = 0.481\\; \\text{days}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The ratio of their orbits (\\(P_Q\\)) is not an integer, so these orbitons are not in a mean motion resonance; for every orbit of \\(M_\\beta\\), \\(M_\\alpha\\) only completes \\(0.481\\) of its orbit, because \\(M_\\alpha\\) takes \\(12.64\\) days longer to orbit the centron than does \\(M_\\beta\\).\nSince a full orbit for either orbiton is \\(360^\\circ\\), we can figure out how many degrees of their orbit each orbiton completes within the system base time unit, which in this case would be \\(1\\) day. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta_\\alpha &= \\dfrac{360^\\circ}{24.36} = 14.778^\\circ \\qquad \\text{The \\emph{minor unit angle}}\\\\\n\\theta_\\beta &= \\dfrac{360^\\circ}{11.72} = 30.717^\\circ  \\qquad \\text{The \\emph{major unit angle}}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis tells us how many degrees \\(M_\\alpha\\) “lags behind” \\(M_\\beta\\) per day: \\[\n\\theta_\\Delta = \\theta_\\beta - \\theta_\\alpha = 30.717^\\circ - 14.778^\\circ = 15.939^\\circ \\qquad \\text{The \\emph{orbiton difference angle}}\n\\] So, every day \\(M_\\beta\\) moves almost \\(16^\\circ\\) farther in its orbit than \\(M_\\alpha\\) does in its orbit.\nWe can also calculate ho many degrees of its orbit \\(M_\\alpha\\) completes (subtends) per each full orbit of \\(M_\\beta\\): \\[\n\\alpha^\\circ = P_Q \\times 360 = 0.481 \\times 360 = 173.202^\\circ\n\\] So, after two of \\(M_\\beta\\)’s orbits: ![[synodion03.jpg|300]] \\[\n2 a^\\circ = (2)(173.202) = 346.404^\\circ\n\\] … \\(M_\\alpha\\) still hasn’t completed one of its orbits, it has only completed \\[\n\\dfrac{346.404}{360} = 0.962\n\\] orbits of the centron.\nConversely, by the time \\(M_\\alpha\\) completes one full orbit of the centron, \\(M_\\beta\\) will have completed \\[\nP_R = \\dfrac{24.36}{11.72} = 2.078\n\\] orbits of the centron.\n![[synodion04.jpg|300]] It is a curious feature of circular motion that if you get far enough ahead of the other body, you eventually come up behind it. Think of a 5000-meter Olympic footrace. All of the competitors start out on the same line and travel in the same direction. Let’s say there are two runners, Number 11 and Number 24.\nNumber 11 quickly pulls out ahead of Number 24 and for a time it is quite obvious that she is “way out ahead”. But if she maintains her higher running speed, eventually she will be so far ahead of Number 24 that she will appear to be running behind them. Anyone looking in on the race at just that moment could be forgiven for thinking that Number 11 is losing, perhaps badly.\nHowever, eventually Number 11 will catch up to Number 24 and pass them again; but for a moment they will be side-by-side, just as they were at the start of the race but not back on the starting line; their meeting point will be some angular distance around the track from where they began. Where and when this moment occurs is entirely a matter of how fast each runner is running.\nReturning to our orbitons, it becomes obvious that at some point while they are orbiting, they will “meet up” at their closest approach to one another, just as our runners did in the Olympic race — they will have achieved synodos. The first synodos to occur after \\(T_0\\) we label \\(T_1\\); the second we label \\(T_2\\), and so on.\nHere’s the really cool thing: we can calculate exactly where and when \\(T_1, T_2\\), etc. take place! #### The When The synodic period (mentioned above) is the period of time that transpires between any two synodoi: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{split}\n\\Sigma &= \\dfrac{P_\\alpha \\times P_\\beta}{|P_\\alpha - P_\\beta|} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{24.36 \\times 11.72}{|24.26 - 11.72|} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{285.499}{12.64} \\\\\n\\Sigma &= 22.587\\; \\text{days ✓}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] So, each synodos occurs just over \\(22\\frac{1}{2}\\) days after the preceding one.\n\nNote that if we divide \\(360^\\circ\\) by the difference angle \\(\\theta_\\Delta\\) \\[\n\\Sigma = \\dfrac{360}{\\theta_\\Delta} = \\dfrac{360}{15.939}= 22.587\\; \\text{days}\n\\] … we also get the synodic period.\n\nNotice that the synodion, \\(22.587\\) days is more than two orbits of \\(M_\\beta\\) and less than one orbit of \\(M_\\alpha\\). If we divide the lengths of each orbiton’s period by the length of the synodion: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_\\alpha &= \\dfrac{P_\\alpha}{\\Sigma} = \\dfrac{24.36}{22.587} = 0.9272\\; \\text{orbit}\\\\\nF_\\beta &= \\dfrac{P_\\beta}{\\Sigma} = \\dfrac{11.72}{22.587} = 1.9272\\; \\text{orbits}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Do you see it? The decimal fraction of both of these quotients is the same: \\(0.9272\\). We designate this as the synodial fraction, and denote it as \\(F_\\Sigma\\), and it helps us to answer the question of “where” the synodoi take place.\nWhat the synodial fraction tells us is that synodos \\(T_1\\) occurs \\(1.9272\\) orbits of \\(M_\\beta\\) and \\(0.9272\\) orbits of \\(M_\\alpha\\) from their starting time (\\(T_0\\)) and place (the base angle \\(B^\\theta\\)). Multiplying the synodial fraction by the number of degrees in a circle: \\[\n\\Theta = F_\\Sigma \\times 360^\\circ = (0.9272)(333.7975^\\circ) \\qquad \\text{The \\emph{synodial angle}}\n\\] Subtracting the synodial angle from \\(360^\\circ\\): \\[\n\\Delta_\\Theta = 360^\\circ - \\Theta = 360^\\circ - 333.7975^\\circ = 26.203^\\circ \\qquad \\text{The \\emph{synodial lag angle}}\n\\] … we now know that each successive synodos occurs \\(22.587\\) days after when and \\(26.203^\\circ\\) “short” of where the previous one occurred. Thus the synodoi “march backward” around the centron. We can calculate the precise angle relative to \\(B^\\theta\\) any given synodos occurs by: \\[\n\\widehat{\\Theta} = 360^\\circ - MOD((S \\times \\Delta_\\Theta), 360)\n\\] where S is the number of the synodos after \\(T_0\\); e.g. for synodos \\(T_6, S = 6\\). ## Diving Deeper Above, we learned about the synodic period equation: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Sigma &= \\dfrac{P_\\alpha \\times P_\\beta}{|P_\\alpha - P_\\beta|} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Here is a comprehensive listing of the related equations: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text{Given: } P_\\alpha &gt; P_\\beta \\\\[1em]\n\\Sigma &= \\dfrac{P_\\alpha P_\\beta}{|P_\\alpha - P_\\beta|}\n& P_\\alpha &= \\dfrac{\\Sigma P_\\beta}{\\Sigma - P_\\beta}\n& P_\\beta &= \\dfrac{\\Sigma P_\\alpha}{\\Sigma + P_\\alpha} \\\\[1em]\n\\dfrac{1}{\\Sigma} &= \\left|\\dfrac{1}{P_\\alpha}-\\dfrac{1}{P_\\beta}\\right|\n& \\dfrac{1}{P_\\alpha} &= \\dfrac{1}{P_\\beta}-\\dfrac{1}{\\Sigma}\n& \\dfrac{1}{P_\\beta} &= \\dfrac{1}{P_\\alpha}+\\dfrac{1}{\\Sigma} \\\\[1em]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nQ &= \\dfrac{P_\\beta}{P_\\alpha}\n&P_\\alpha = P_\\beta \\times R = \\dfrac{P_\\beta}{Q}\n= \\left(\\dfrac{\\Sigma}{Q} - \\Sigma\\right) = \\Sigma(R - 1) \\\\[1em]\nR &= \\dfrac{P_\\alpha}{P_\\beta}\n&P_\\beta = P_\\alpha \\times Q = \\dfrac{P_\\alpha}{R}\n= \\left(\\Sigma - \\dfrac{\\Sigma}{R}\\right) = \\Sigma(1-Q)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nWhere: - \\(\\Sigma\\) = synodion - \\(P_\\alpha\\) = period of the outer body, \\(M_\\alpha\\) (longer) - \\(P_\\beta\\) = period of the inner body, \\(M_\\beta\\) (shorter) - \\(Q\\) = quotient of the outer body period to the inner body period - \\(R\\) = ratio of the inner body period to the outer body period\n\nNote that the second row of equations perform the same calculations as the first row by using the reciprocals of the orbital periods.\n\nAll of this leads us naturally to the question:\n\nDoes any future synodos ever fall precisely at the base angle \\(B^\\theta\\) again? In other words is \\[\n\\widehat{\\Theta} = 0^\\circ\n\\] … ever true after \\(T_0\\)?\n\nThe answer is “yes” and we can calculate that, too.",

    "section": "15.4 The Synodial Epoch",
    "text": "15.4 The Synodial Epoch\nThe synodial epoch (\\(Y\\)) is the time interval after which a synodion occurs at the base angle \\(B^\\theta\\) agin, completing a full cycle.\nThe epochal aggregate (\\(Y_0\\)) is the total number of synodia that transpire within a synodial epoch.\nWhereas we used the synodic formula: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Sigma &= \\dfrac{P_\\alpha \\times P_\\beta}{|P_\\alpha - P_\\beta|} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] to calculate the synodic period, we need to use a different method to calculate the Epochal Aggregate; we employ both the Least Common Multiple (LCM) and the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD): \\[\nLCM(a, b) = \\dfrac{a \\times b}{GCD(a, b)}\n\\] &gt;❗️Important ❗️ &gt;1. Most modern calculators, spreadsheets, and programming languages have built-in functions for calculating both LCM and GCD, but be aware that both of these can only be correctly calculated for integer inputs. If something like LCM(1.5, 3.3) returns a value rather than an error, it will likely be the LCM of 1 and 3, not of 1.5 and 3.3. &gt;2. The GCD can be calculated by hand using the Euclidean Algorithm (detailed elsewhere), calculators, spreadsheets, or programmed scripts are much faster.\nWe need to calculate the LCM of \\(P_\\alpha = 24.36\\) and \\(P_\\beta = 11.72\\), but neither of these are integers, so we normalize them by multiplying by the factor of ten which will render the more precise of the two into an integer value. In this case, both have two decimal places of precision, so multiplying by \\(10^2 = 100\\) will be sufficient: \\[\nP'_\\alpha = 24.36 \\times 100 = 2436 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P'_\\beta = 11.72 \\times 100 = 1172\n\\] Now we can compute the LCM by: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{split}\nLCM(a, b) &= \\dfrac{a \\times b}{GCD(a, b)} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\dfrac{2436 \\times 1172}{GCD(2436, 1172)} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\dfrac{2854992}{4} \\\\\n&= 713748\\; ✓\n\\end{split}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Now, since we normalized our inputs by scaling up by a factor of \\(10^2 = 100\\), we need to scale this result down by the same factor: \\[\nY_0 = \\dfrac{713748}{100} = 7137.48\\; \\text{days } ✓\n\\] The epochal interval (\\(\\Psi\\)) is calculated by dividing the Epochal Aggregate (\\(Y_0\\)) by the synodic period (\\(\\Sigma\\)): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{split}\n\\Psi &= \\dfrac{Y_0}{\\Sigma} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\dfrac{7137.48}{22.587} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 316\\; \\text{synodia}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] This reveals that \\(T_{316}\\) occurs in the same configuration at the base angle \\(B^\\theta\\). We can double-check by supplying \\(S=316\\) to our synodian instance angle (\\(\\widehat{\\Theta}\\)) equation: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{split}\n\\widehat{\\Theta} &= 360^\\circ - MOD((S \\times \\Lambda_\\Theta), 360^\\circ) \\\\\n&= 360^\\circ - MOD((316 \\times 26.203^\\circ), 360^\\circ) \\\\\n&= 360^\\circ - 360^\\circ \\\\\n&= 0\\; ✓\n\\end{split}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] To convert the epochal aggregate \\(\\Psi = 7137.48\\) days into something more useful, we can divide by the number of days in a sidereal year (\\(≈ 365.2564\\)): \\[\nY_0^y = \\dfrac{7137.48}{365.2564} = 19.54\\; \\text{years }✓\n\\] … which is about \\[\n19^y\\;197^d\\;11^h\\;16^m\\;20.724^s\n\\] give-or-take a millisecond. ### Quarter Synodial Epoch #### The Where A quarter synodial epoch (\\(Y_{/4}\\)) is an important quantity, as well; at these intervals, synodoi occur precisely on a cardinal angle (\\(90^\\circ, 180^\\circ, 270^\\circ\\)) in succession. We call these the cardinal synodoi. They occur, of course every one fourth of the synodion: \\[\nY_{/4} = \\dfrac{Y_0}{4}\n\\] In our worked example above, the quarter synodial epoch is: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_{/4} = \\dfrac{Y_0}{4} = \\dfrac{7137.48}{4} = 1784.37\\; \\text{days} \\\\[0.5em]\nY_{/4}^y = \\dfrac{Y_{/4}}{365.2564} = \\dfrac{1784.37}{365.2564} ≈ 4.89\\; \\text{years}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] ### Quarter Epochal Interval Similarly, a quarter epochal interval (\\(\\Psi_{/4}\\)) is the number of common synodoi that occur between cardinal synodoi: \\[\n\\Psi_{/4} = \\dfrac{\\Psi_0}{4} = \\dfrac{316}{4} = 79\\; \\text{synodoi}\n\\] ### The Epochal Complements There are two of these, the epochal major complement (\\(Y_\\alpha\\)) and the epochal minor complement (\\(Y_\\beta\\)), which are the number of complete orbits of orbiton \\(M_\\alpha\\) and \\(M_\\beta\\), respectively, per each synodial epoch: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_\\alpha &= \\dfrac{Y_0}{P_\\alpha} \\\\[1em]\nY_\\beta &= \\dfrac{Y_0}{P_\\beta}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] In our worked example above: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_\\alpha &= \\dfrac{Y_0}{P_\\alpha} = \\dfrac{7137.48}{24.36} = 293\\; \\text{orbits }✓ \\\\[1em]\nY_\\beta &= \\dfrac{Y_0}{P_\\beta} = \\dfrac{7137.48}{11.72} = 609\\; \\text{orbits }✓\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",

    "text": "17.6 Monon Morphotypes and Conformations\nAll monons should be thought of as falling roughly into one of four categories of morphotypes:\n\nLithic (from Greek lithos “stone, rock”) – Fully solid planemons (rocky, carbon-rich, metallic elements).\nAstatic (from Greek a “not, none” + status “state condition”) – Mixed-phase planemons (icy, oceanic, or chemically altered worlds that have no fixed state).\nAetheric (from Latin aer “air”) – Gaseous planemons (gas dwarfs, ice giants, and gas giants).\nUlsic (from Latin uls “beyond”) – Exotic or theoretical matter planemons (placeholder for degenerate matter planemons — neutron stars, black holes, quark stars, etc. — if needed).\n\nThe first three compositions span specific density ranges:\n\nLithic: 3.5 g/cm³ – 8.0 g/cm³ (0.6347⨁ – 1.451⨁)\nAstatic: 1.0 g/cm³ – &lt;3.5 g/cm³ (0.1814⨁ – 0.6347⨁)\nAetheric: 0.1 g/cm³ – 1.0 g/cm³ (0.0181⨁ – 0.1814⨁)\n\nAnd each has subsets, called conformations:\n\nLithic Morphotype\n\nPetriform: Rocky, silicate-based planemons.\nCarboform: Carbon-dominated (graphite, diamond) planemons\n\nAstatic Morphotype\n\nPagoform: Ice-rich planemons (frozen volatiles like water, ammonia, methane, etc.)\nFluxiform: Liquid-dominated planemons (H₂O, but also other volatiles)\n\n**Aetheric Morphotype\n\nTransiform: Gas Dwarfs\nPneumoform: Ice Giants\nHaliform: Gas Giants\n\n\nThese are intended to categorize monons in their current configuration. A monon may (usually will) assume different qualities depending on its age and environment.## Abstract\nMajor Topics:\n- Provides the canonical reference table for monon mass classes and monoclasses, establishing the taxonomy framework used across WCB.\n- Defines the hierarchical structure of –moic categories by mass domain:\n- micromon, minimon, midimon, planemon, intermon, stellamon, supermon, ultramon, hypermon.\n- Associates each category with its mass range, radius bounds, and representative examples (from asteroids to stellar bodies).\n- Establishes the system of terracentric prefixes (centiterran, deciterran, kiloterran, megaterran, etc.) for finer-grained scaling across mass domains.\n- Connects monoclasses (e.g., telluric, rheatic, gaean) with their appropriate mass classes, showing where habitability-relevant subtypes emerge.\n- Serves as the master framework to which specialized notes (e.g., Gaean planemons, Rheatic planemons) attach.\nKey Terms & Symbols:\n- Mass classes: micromon, minimon, midimon, planemon, intermon, stellamon, supermon, ultramon, hypermon.\n- Terracentric scaling prefixes: centiterran, deciterran, kiloterran, megaterran, etc.\n- Ontotype: compositional subtypes (telluric, rheatic, gaean, xenotic).\n- µT (microterran units): mass measure used for micromons and smaller classes.\nCross-Check Notes:\n- This file provides the systemic backbone for all WCB classification work.\n- All major terms are already present in the glossary as of v1.222.\n- Future consideration: whether terracentric prefixes warrant their own glossary entry or remain embedded in this reference note.",

Monoclass is not emergent:\nA system of planemons is not a larger planemon.\nA binary of stellamons is not a single, larger stellamon.\n2. Modeling convenience ≠ ontological unity:\n- For orbital mechanics, it’s useful to model a binary pair as a single object of combined mass.\n- But ontotypically, the barycentered abstraction is not a monon\n3. Distinct gravitational fields:\n- A monon has one center of mass, even if dynamic (e.g., fast-rotating planemon).\n- A system has multiple discrete gravitational centers, even if mathematically reducible. For instance in a double-star stellmonic system, it is convenient to treat the two stellamons as a single stellamon of their combined mass, centered on the barycenter of their orbits, but this is a mathematical construct based on a property of the system they comprise, not an object-in-itself.",

    "text": "16.1 Physical Properties of Monons\nMajor Topics:\n- Defines five fundamental physical properties of monons:\n- Mass (m): total matter present (distinct from weight).\n- Density (ρ): matter per unit volume, affected by composition and gravitational compression.\n- Radius (r): center-to-surface distance, treated as emergent from mass and density.\n- Surface Gravity (g): acceleration at the surface, dependent on mass and radius.\n- Escape Velocity (v): minimum speed to overcome gravity, also dependent on mass and radius.\n- Explains interdependence: radius emergent from mass and density, density altered by gravitational compression, gravity and escape velocity derived from the mass–radius relationship.\n- Notes inverse-square law as foundation for gravitational effects.\n- Invokes sed ego dico as an editorial simplification, prioritizing usability over perfect physical rigor.\n- Provides real-world analogies (e.g., water vs. iron density) to clarify concepts.\nKey Terms & Symbols:\n- m, ρ, r, g, v — monon equations of state variables.\n- Gravitational Compression [neo].\n- Inverse-square law [sci].\n- Sed ego dico [meta].\nCross-Check Notes:\n- All five properties are already defined in canon and equations of state.\n- Gravitational Compression [neo] reinforced.\n- Inverse-square law [sci] already established in stellar/orbital contexts.\n- Sed ego dico [meta] consistent with existing editorial conventions.\n- Status: [EXPANDED] — reinforces existing canon with emphasis on emergent and interdependent properties.\nThere are five properties of monons that can be thought of as physical properties — insofar as they describe the monon physically or a property of the monon that emerges from the other physical properties. These are:\nThese are all intricately interrelated in ways that are much more complicated than we need to account for here. For instance, while radius is derived from mass and density, it also matters how strongly the mass of the monon is gravitationally acting on itself. This causes gravitational compression, which means that the matter is forced into a denser configuration than it would otherwise exhibit if it were not under such intense gravitational pull. So, it is also true that density in some sense is derived from mass and radius.\nSurface gravity and escape velocity are also very dependent on both mass and radius. The farther a point on the surface of the monon is from the monon’s center, the less gravitational attraction from the monon it experiences, decreasing according to the inverse-square law (more on this later). And the weaker the surface gravity, the less energy it takes to overcome it, so the lower the escape velocity.\nFor our purposes, it is reasonable to simplify things and say:\n… and not be too overly concerned about the subtleties.\nYes; this is our first official invocation of sed ego dico, “because I say”. No, it’s not entirely physically accurate, but it’s good enough for what we need to accomplish.\nMass and density are also dependent upon what materials the monon is made of: most monons are composed of several materials (rock, ice, liquid water, etc.). Rock, itself, can composed of any number of more basic elements and compounds.\nAnd all of these materials have their own inherent densities. Water, for instance, has a density of about 1.0 g/cm³ (and is, in fact the standard for material density in the metric system we’re using.) Iron, on the other hand, has a density of about 7.7 g/cm³ — almost eight times that of water. So 1 kilogram of water takes up more volume than one kilogram of iron.",

(Mass and weight are not the same — weight depends on gravity; mass does not.)\nDensity (ρ): The average amount of matter per unit volume — essentially, how tightly packed the monon’s materials are. This depends on both composition (e.g. rock, ice, metal) and, for larger bodies, gravitational self-compression.\nRadius (r): The distance from the monon’s center to its surface. Technically, this is derived from the monon’s mass and average density — but more on this in a moment.\nSurface Gravity (g): The strength of gravitational acceleration at the monon’s surface — how strongly it attracts objects located one radius away from its center.\nEscape Velocity (v): The minimum speed needed to completely escape the monon’s gravity when starting from the surface — how much velocity is required to leave the monon entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\nRadius is an emergent property of the interaction of mass and density.\n\n\n\nKeppy: Sed ego dico, right?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an old riddle, which was a favorite of my maternal grandfather: “Which is heavier — a pound of iron or a pound of feathers?” The trick to the question, of course, is that both weigh a pound, but because feathers are less dense than iron, that pound (in its natural state) takes up far more volume than does the iron.",

A few recurring themes: - Tidal locking is expected for monons in the habitable zones of M-dwarfs, due to proximity.\n- Initial rotation rates may depend on:\n- Accretion history\n- Giant impacts (e.g., the Moon-forming event)\n- Early tidal evolution - Resonant rotations - Mercury’s 3:2 spin-orbit resonance may be more common than full tidal locking - Close-in monons may be more likely spin slowly or be tidally locked - Moons (especially those whose mass is a significant fraction of the monon’s) can stabilize or slow a monon’s rotation rate - This is happening with Earth; our day is lengthening by ≈ 17 microseconds per year, or 1 second every 58800 years - Giant impacts can reset rotation direction and/or speed\nOrbital Eccentricity (e) - e ∈ ⟨0 ∧ 0.25⟩ — General Geotic Tolerance - e ∈ ⟨0.01 ∧ 0.10⟩ — Earth-clone ideal range - In multi-monon systems, stable configurations usually result in e &lt; 0.10 per monon - In single-monon (only-child) or widely spaced systems, values up to e ≈ 0.25 may remain dynamically stable, but tend to reduce overall habitability - Risks of e &gt; 0.25 - Large insolation differentials between periastron and apastron - Pronounced climatic volatility - Less likelihood of maintaining persistent, stable biospheres - Increased vulnerability to orbital perturbations - Possible transit through and out of the system’s habitable zone (HZ) during a single orbit - Note: On a world with zero axial tilt (ε = 0), high eccentricity might act as a surrogate for seasonal variation — producing orbit-phase-based temperature cycles. This is technically viable, but requires very careful tuning of orbital shape, atmospheric thermal inertia, and surface conditions to avoid extreme or catastrophic conditions.\nOrbital Period (C) - This parameter can’t be freely chosen — it’s governed by Kepler’s Third Law, originally formulated as \\[P^2 \\propto a^3\\]and later regularized by Newton to account for the total mass of the system - The orbital period depends on both the distance of the monon’s orbit and the combined masses of the star(s) and monon. \\[C = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{a^3}{M + m}}\\] where: - C = the orbital period of the monon in perannum - a = the monon’s orbit’s semi-major axis in Astronomical Units - M = the mass of the star in solar units (⊙) - m = the mass of the monon (also in solar units) - In most systems, m « M and can be neglected for quick calculations: \\[C = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{a^3}{M}}\\] …However, if the monon’s mass exceeds ≈ 10% of the mass of the star(s), its contribution to the period of its orbit begins to have noticeable effects. This is especially relevant for: - Super-Jovian mass monons orbiting red-dwarf stars (q.v.) - Binary monon systems - See Sidebar Module – Two-body Systems - See also Sidebar Module – Double-monon or monon-moon?\n\nI include C here not because it’s adjustable, but because it’s crucial to the seasonal dynamics of a world:\n\nIt modulates how axial tilt (\\(\\varepsilon_x\\)) and eccentricity (e) express over time\n\nIt defines the length of seasons, and whether rotation (D) is fast or slow relative to the year\n\nIt affects the precession timescale (χ) through long-term resonances\n\nIn short: IF you declare C, that choice constrains what kind of star your system can have.\n\nSee Sidebar Module – Stars, Planetary Orbits, and Habitable Zones for details\n\nNote that the masses of other monons in the system have no effect in this equation!\n\nObliquity (Axial tilt) (\\(\\varepsilon_x\\)) - \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) ∈ ⟨0° ∧ 5°⟩ — Negligible seasonal variation - \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) ∈ ⟨15° ∧ 35°⟩ — Plausible range for active seasonal variation - \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) ∈ ⟨20° ∧ 30°⟩ — Earth-normal like - \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) ∈ ⟨35° ∧ 45°⟩ — Extreme seasonal variation unless mitigated by atmosphere/oceans - \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) &gt; 45° — Potentially unstable - Polar and tropical regions actually reverse!\nA monon does not have to have an axial tilt, but most do, because their mass isn’t evenly distributed throughout their volume, and that mass is tugged on by the host star(s), companion Moons, other monons in their star system, etc.\nPrecession Cycle (χ) - χ ∈ ⟨15 ∧ 60⟩ ky — General Geotics range - χ ∈ ⟨20 ∧ 30⟩ ky — Earth-clone ideal range - Note: If your monon has an axial tilt (\\(\\varepsilon_x ≠ 0\\)), it will have an axial precession period. - &lt; 5 ky - Too fast - Rapid climatic swings - Possibly preventive of long-term stable ecosystems - 5 – 15 ky - Can support meaningful precession cycles - More frequent variation - 20 – 30 ky - Earth-normal range - Ideal for familar Milankovitch-style climate pacing - 30 – 60 ky - Acceptible - Modulates long-term climate, but with slower variability - &gt; 60 ky - May mute precessional influence - monon becomes dependent on ε or e (or a combination) for seasonal variation - Habitability-Relevant Impacts of Axial Precession - Precession alone doesn’t cause climate variation—but it modulates how obliquity and eccentricity combine with seasons. - Precession rate is influenced by monon tilt, mass distribution, rotation rate, and gravitational interactions (especially from moons or nearby monons). - Moderately long precessional periods (25–30 kyr) help establish stable, regular Milankovitch cycles conducive to long-term ecosystem resilience. - Affected by: - Axial tilt (\\(\\varepsilon_x\\)) — higher tilts tend to precess faster. - Rotation rate — faster rotation yields a stronger equatorial bulge (which enhances precession). - Internal structure — core-to-mantle mass distribution changes the monon’s moment of inertia. - Gravitational interactions — especially from moons or other monons in the system.\nObliquity Azimuth (\\(\\zeta_{n}\\)) - \\(\\zeta_{n}\\) ∈ ⟨0° ∧ 359°⟩ — Measure of the directionality of the monons’ obliquity relative to the periastron of its orbit. - \\(\\zeta_0\\) is defined as the orientation when the planemon’s northern hemisphere is tilted precisely away from the star or system barycenter (ḅ) (northern solstice) at periastron. - This is called periaptic zero. - \\(\\zeta_{90}\\) would indicate that northern solstice has precessed 90° around the monon’s orbital path from periaptic zero. - \\(\\zeta_{180}\\) would indicate that the northern solstice is occurring at apastron, the point in the monon’s orbit farthest away from the star/barycenter. - IMPORTANT: - For \\(\\varepsilon_0\\) monons (they have no axial tilt), \\(\\zeta_x\\) is undefined.\nMagnetosphere (radiation shielding) (\\(B_{surf}\\)) - \\(B_{surf}\\) refers to the surface magnetic field strength, measured in microteslas (μT).\n- For Earth, the typical surface field ranges between 25–65 μT, depending on latitude and local crustal anomalies. - \\(B_{surf} &lt; 5 \\mu T\\) — Unshielded; high cosmic radiation exposure, especially polar regions- - \\(B_{surf} \\in \\langle5 \\wedge 20\\rangle \\mu T\\) — Minimal shielding; monon parahabitable without O₃ layer and/or thick tmosphere - \\(B_{surf} \\in \\langle20 \\wedge 40\\rangle \\mu T\\) — Weak field; still protective but slightly more porous - \\(B_{surf} \\in \\langle40 \\wedge 70\\rangle \\mu T\\) — Comparable to Earth; effective radiation shielding - \\(B_{surf} \\in \\langle25 \\wedge 65\\rangle \\mu T\\) — Earth’s typical magnetosphere strength range - \\(B_{surf} \\in \\langle70, ..,100\\rangle \\mu T\\) — Significant shielding, but with growing secondary effects - \\(B_{surf} &gt; 100 \\mu T\\) — Magnetosphere begins trapping too much radiation - Where the magnetosphere is concerned, there is such a thing as “too much of a good thing”; once the field strength exceeds ~100 μT, the magnetosphere may begin to trap radiation instead of deflecting it — causing the very problems it’s meant to prevent. - \\(B_{surf} &gt; 400 \\mu T\\) — Gas giant strength; radiation belts around monon make space travel exceedingly hazardous. - Why It Matters - A strong magnetic field deflects charged particles from the stellar wind, forming a magnetosphere.\n- Without this protection:\n- Atmospheric erosion increases (especially from solar UV and wind) - Surface radiation levels rise, particularly in equatorial and polar regions - Ozone layers and other protective atmospheric chemistry can degrade - Mars is the cautionary tale: once magnetically active, its core solidified early, its field collapsed, and it lost most of its atmosphere to space. - What Generates It? - A monon’s magnetic field typically arises from a dynamo effect — the movement of conductive fluid (usually liquid iron) in its outer core: - Requires: - Electrically conductive material - Rotation (faster helps) - Active convection in the core (driven by heat and composition gradients) - Influenced by: - Core size and composition (metallicity) - Rotation rate (d) — faster rotation generally strengthens dynamo action - Internal heat flux — related to mass, age, and radioactive element content - See Sidebar Module – Estimating Planetary Magnetospheres for details on estimating magnetospheres according to monon parameters.",

    "section": "21.1 Physical vs Emergent Properties",
    "text": "21.1 Physical vs Emergent Properties\nThe first two — mass and density — are fundamental physical properties. If an object is composed of a specific material (e.g., pure iron), then: - Its density reflects the compactness of that material under standard conditions.\n- Its mass is the product of that density and volume. These values are not “fuzzy” — they are determined by composition. But there’s a complicating factor:\n\n21.1.1 Uncompressed Density in WCB\nIn reality, high-mass monons compress themselves under their own gravity. This self-compression: - Increases core pressure\n- Reduces actual volume\n- Nudges the average (measured) density upward Unfortunately, the feedback between mass, gravity, and compression is: - This feedback loop is nonlinear\n- The corrections vary by material type\n- And modeling it accurately requires complex equations of state WCB intentionally avoids this complexity in favor of practical worldcrafting.\n\nWCB Convention:\nWe treat ρ (density) as the uncompressed density of the monon — the intrinsic density of its materials assuming no internal gravitational compression.\n\nThis keeps ρ symbolically independent from m and allows us to calculate r, g, and vₑ without recursive modeling. Compression effects are minimal within the Geotic range ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁, so this simplification is physically tolerable and worldcrafter-friendly.\n\n\n21.1.2 Parameter Precedence: A Symbolic Hierarchy\nIn WCB, we adopt a symbolic precedence system to clarify what depends on what. #### First Precedence: Composition-Driven Parameters - Mass (m)\n- Uncompressed Density (ρ) These are primary constraints, based on: - Material class\n- Planetary category\n- Biospheric plausibility\n- Narrative or symbolic intention #### Second Precedence: Experiential Parameters - Surface Gravity (g)\n- Escape Velocity (vₑ) These depend on m and ρ, and describe how a being would experience the world. They answer: - “How heavy do things feel?”\n- “How hard is it to launch something into space?” Because they’re experiential, g and vₑ serve as thresholds for habitability and filters for narrative design.\n\nFor writers of SF, escape velocity might be of slightly greater import, as they are often more concerned with getting characters out of the monon’s gravity well. #### Third Precedence: Emergent Parameter - Radius (r) We treat radius as an emergent quantity, derived from the interplay between m and ρ. Once those are specified, r is computed using: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nr &= \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3 m}{4 \\pi \\rho}} &&\\qquad \\text{Absolute Calculation} \\\\\nr &= \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{m}{\\rho}} &&\\qquad \\text{Relative calculation}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] By defining ρ as uncompressed, we sidestep recursive compression modeling and free r to play its proper role as a derived result.\n\n\nIn short: Radius is not arbitrarily assigned in WCB — it emerges from first principles, and that’s exactly what gives it flexibility.\n\nHowever, if a monon meets all other Geotic criteria but falls slightly outside the ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ radius guideline, there is room for flex — especially when symbolic or experiential factors support it. ### Surface Gravity, Escape Velocity, and Radius “Flexibility” We maintain the general Geotic envelope of ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ for all five core parameters. However — as discussed in Example: When Good Values Go Bad — not all combinations of any two parameters will yield outputs that remain Geotic.\nTo test this, we evaluated all combinations of mass (m) and uncompressed density (ρ) within the Geotic range (⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁), using an increment of 0.05⨁ for each. From these, we calculated the corresponding: - Surface Gravity (g)\n- Escape Velocity (vₑ)\n- Radius (r)\n#### Results from Evaluated Combinations: - Gravity (g) — derived from m and ρ:\n- All values fell within the expected ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ range.\n- Escape Velocity (vₑ) — derived from m and ρ:\n- Calculated range was ⟨0.7071 ∧ 1.2247⟩⨁.\n- Radius (r) — derived from m and ρ:\n- Calculated range was ⟨0.6934 ∧ 1.4423⟩⨁. Conclusion:\nAll outputs for g, vₑ, and r computed from Geotic-range values of m and ρ remain within or closely near the ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁ constraint window.\n\nReminder:\nWhile mass and density serve as primary constraints, the values they generate for gravity, escape velocity, and radius are emergent — and may push right up to the edges of Geotic acceptability. monons with marginal values on one or more of these outputs may still qualify symbolically, depending on biospheric or narrative justification.",

However:\n\n⚠️ Caution:\nMass (m) and uncompressed density (ρ) are treated as inflexible physical constraints in WCB.

While higher-multiplicity arrangements are common and fascinating, they introduce significant mathematical and physical complexity beyond the current scope of this guide. # The Basics Binary systems consist of two bodies bound in a mutual gravitational relationship, each tracing an orbital path around a shared center of mass known as the barycenter (ḅ). This point, ||shown as a black X in the figure||, always lies along the line connecting the centers of the two bodies and is not a massive object itself, but a calculated position determined by the masses and separation of the components.\nWhen the two objects are of unequal masses (\\(M_2 &lt; M_1\\)), the more massive object (the primary body) orbits on an elliptical path, on average closer to the barycenter, while the secondary body traces a larger elliptical path on average farther from the barycenter. Both orbits share the same eccentricity (\\(e\\)), and are synchronized in period, preserving the balance of angular momentum. They differ only in extent.\nA binary system is described by a total of nine dimensions:\n… as well as the masses of the two bodies: - \\(M_1\\): the primary mass (\\(P\\)) - \\(M_2\\): the secondary mass (\\(S\\))\n… and the eccentricity of their orbits: - \\(e\\): a dimensionless value that describes the deviation of the orbital paths from perfectly circular; \\(e = 0\\) means the orbit is a circle\nThese are related through a series of equations, which may seem daunting at first, but are quite straightforward once they are understood. ### Primary Dimensions \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP_{avg} &= \\mathcal{A} \\times\\dfrac{M_S}{M_P+M_S} \\qquad &&\\text{Primary average distance}\\\\[1em]\nP_{min} &= P_{avg}(1 - e) \\qquad &&\\text{Primary minimum distance} \\\\[1em]\nP_{max} &= P_{avg}(1 + e) \\qquad &&\\text{Primary maximum distance}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] ### Secondary Dimensions \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_{avg} &= \\mathcal{A} \\times\\dfrac{M_P}{M_P+M_S} \\qquad &&\\text{Secondary average distance}\\\\[1em]\nS_{min} &= S_{avg}(1 - e) \\qquad &&\\text{Secondary minimum distance} \\\\[1em]\nS_{max} &= S_{avg}(1 + e) \\qquad &&\\text{Secondary maximum distance}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] ### Total (Overall) Dimensions \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT_{min} = \\mathcal{A}(1 - e)\n= P_{min} + S_{min} = T_{max}\\left(\\dfrac{1 - e}{1 + e}\\right) \\\\\nT_{max} = \\mathcal{A}(1 + e)\n= P_{max} + S_{max} = T_{min}\\left(\\dfrac{1 + e}{1 - e}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathcal{A} = \\dfrac{T_{min}}{1 - e}\n= \\dfrac{T_{max}}{1 + e}\n= P_{avg} + S_{avg}\\\\[0.5em]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] ### Eccentricity Relationships &gt; In the equations below a subscript dot \\(_{\\bullet}\\) means any two matching parameters; e.g. \\(Max_{\\bullet} - Min_{\\bullet}\\) means any maximum value minus any minimum value of the same parameter, such as \\(P_{max} - P_{min}\\). #### System Eccentricity \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ne &= \\dfrac{Max_\\bullet - Min_{\\bullet}}{Max_\\bullet + Min_{\\bullet}}\n\\;\\;=\\;\\; \\left[1 - \\dfrac{Min_{\\bullet}}{Avg_{\\bullet}}\\right]\n\\;\\;=\\;\\; \\left[\\dfrac{Max_{\\bullet}}{Avg_{\\bullet}} - 1\\right] \\\\[1em]\n&= \\left(P_{max} \\times \\dfrac{M_P + M_S}{\\mathcal{A} \\times M_S}\\right) - 1\n\\quad = \\quad 1 - \\left(P_{min} \\times \\dfrac{M_P + M_S}{\\mathcal{A} \\times M_S}\\right) \\\\[1em]\n&= \\left(S_{max} \\times \\dfrac{M_P + M_S}{\\mathcal{A} \\times M_P}\\right) - 1\n\\quad = \\quad 1 - \\left(S_{min} \\times \\dfrac{M_P + M_S}{\\mathcal{A} \\times M_P}\\right) \\\\[1em]\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] #### The Crux Metric (\\(\\acute{e}\\)) &gt; The circle \\(_{\\circ}\\) subscript is used to indicate expressions in which all terms share the same positional magnitude (e.g., max, min, or average), regardless of parameter type. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\acute{e} = \\dfrac{M_P - M_S}{M_P + M_S}\n= \\dfrac{|S_{\\circ} - P_{\\circ}|}{S_{\\circ} + P_{\\circ}}\n= \\dfrac{|S_{\\circ} - P_{\\circ}|}{T_{\\circ}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] - \\(é\\) (e-prime) is the system eccentricity value at which the orbits of the stars become adjoined tangential \\((e &gt; 0; M_P \\neq M_S)\\) - For a mass ratio of \\(^{M_S}/_{M_P} = 0.8\\), the system requires \\(\\acute{e} ≥ 0.8519\\) for the primary and secondary orbits to adjoin tangentially (see below).\nThere are times (such as when the Secondary is less massive than the Primary — typically \\(\\frac{M_1}{M_2} &gt;rsim 80\\), the approximate star/brown dwarf mass dividing line, but it works for sub-stellamon bodies as well — it is convenient to treat the Primary as stationary and the Secondary as following the relative orbit alone. Therefore, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_{min} = T_{min} \\\\[0.5em]\nR_{avg} = \\mathcal{A} \\\\[0.5em]\nR_{max} = T_{max} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] For instance, in the case of the Earth-Sun system: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{A} &= 1.0 AU \\\\[0.5em]\nP_{avg} &= \\mathcal{A} \\times\\dfrac{M_S}{M_P+M_S} \\\\[1em]\n&= 1.0 \\times \\frac{1}{333000+1} \\\\[1em]\n&= 1.0 \\times \\frac{1}{333001} = 3.009299 \\times 10^{-6} AU \\\\[1.5em]\n1 \\text{ AU } &= 1.496 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km} \\\\\n\\therefore P_{avg} &= 3.009299 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 1.496 \\times 10^8 ≈ 449 \\text{ km}  \n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nConsidering that the Sun’s radius is \\(696{,}340\\) km, a wobble of only \\(≈ 450\\) km (\\(\\approx 0.065\\%\\)) is justifiably negligible, so the math works out well enough by just treating the Sun as stationary and the Earth as orbiting it. # Barycentrics Similarly to the Relative Orbit of the Secondary, when dealing with a system where \\(M_S ≈ M_P\\), it becomes more convenient to think of the masses as stationary and their barycenter “orbiting” between them. |graphic to be added| \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_{min} &=   \\frac{\\mathcal{a}(1 - e)\\; M_S}{M_P + M_S}\n= \\frac{T_{min}\\; M_S}{M_P + M_S} = B_{avg}(1 - e) = \\mathbf{P_{min}} \\\\[2em]\nB_{avg} &= \\frac{\\mathcal{a}\\; M_S}{M_P + M_S} = \\mathbf{P_{avg}} \\\\[2em]\nB_{max} &= \\frac{\\mathcal{a}(1 + e)\\; M_S}{M_P + M_S}\n= \\frac{T_{max}\\; M_S}{M_P + M_S} = B_{avg}(1 + e) = \\mathbf{P_{max}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Where: - \\(\\mathcal{a}\\) = the average separation between the Primary in and the Secondary expressed in terms of the radius of the Primary - \\(M_P\\) = the mass of the Primary - \\(M_S\\) = the mass of the Secondary - \\(e\\) = the eccentricity of the system\nIf the mass of the Secondary (\\(M_S\\)) is expressed in terms of the mass of the Primary (\\(M_P\\)) the equations become: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_0 &= \\frac{M_S}{M_P} \\\\[1em]\nB_{min} &= \\frac{\\mathcal{a}(1 - e)\\; M_0}{M_0 + 1}\n= \\frac{T_{min}\\; M_0}{M_0 + 1} = B_{avg}(1 - e) = \\mathbf{P_{min}} \\\\[2em]\nB_{avg} &= \\frac{\\mathcal{a}\\; M_0}{M_0 + 1} = \\mathbf{P_{avg}} \\\\[2em]\nB_{max} &= \\frac{\\mathcal{a}(1 + e)\\; M_0}{M_0 + 1}\n= \\frac{T_{max}\\; M_0}{M_0 + 1} = B_{avg}(1 + e) = \\mathbf{P_{max}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Note that in both sets of equations, the math works out such that the dimensions of the barycenter’s “orbit” precisely match those of the Primary’s orbit; this is incredibly convenient, as it allows us to directly compare the geometry of the barycenter’s orbit to the physical dimensions of the Primary, in particular the Primary’s radius (\\(R_P\\)) — more on this below.",

    "section": "20.1 Mass Pairings",
    "text": "20.1 Mass Pairings\nSolar analog stars are more often than not found in binary or multiple systems than not, with over half exhibiting multiplicity.\n\nDuquennoy & Mayor (1991) originally found that approximately 57% of solar-type stars (spectral types F6-K3 — more-or-less what WCB calls Solar Cognates) in the solar neighborhood are part of binary or higher-order systems.\nRaghavan et al. (2010) updated this with modern data for the same spectral class range, reporting:\n\n~44% as binaries\n\n~11% as triples or higher\n\n→ Yielding a total multiplicity fraction of ~55% for solar-type stars.\n\n\nThis tendency toward multiplicity defines a pattern that profoundly influences system architecture, orbital stability zones, and the landscape of potential habitability. ### Companion Mass Trends by Primary Type\nFrom the combined statistical analyses of Duquennoy & Mayor (1991), Raghavan et al. (2010), Moe & Di Stefano (2017), and Li et al. (2022, LAMOST), a clear pattern of Primary-to-Secondary spectral type pairings emerges: the spectral class of the primary star strongly constrains the range of companion masses likely to occur. In other words, binary pairing is not random across the mass spectrum.\n\nEarly-type primaries (A–F) tend to draw secondaries from a narrow, high-mass corridor, favoring near-equal companions—what observers call the twin excess.\n\nSolar-type primaries (G-class) exhibit a broader, moderately declining distribution, allowing both near-equal companions and somewhat smaller partners (typically late G or K types).\n\nCooler primaries (K–M) show a progressively wider, low-mass-biased spread, where secondaries are often much smaller—late K, M, or even substellar companions.\n\nThis trend can be summarized as:\n\nEarlier, hotter stars → narrow, high-q pairing range (favoring twins).\nLater, cooler stars → broad, low-q range (favoring lighter companions).\n\nCalculating a Secondary star’s mass (\\(M_2\\)) based on the mass of the Primary (\\(M_1\\)): \\[\nM_2 = M_1 \\times ⟨⟨a ∧ b⟩⟩^{k}\n\\] Where: - \\(M_1\\) — primary mass\n- \\(M_2\\) — secondary mass (assigned)\n- \\(⟨⟨a ∧ b⟩⟩\\) — random draw between a and b (inclusive range)\n- \\(k\\) — optional weighting exponent, biasing toward the lower or upper bound\n- \\(k = 1\\): uniform distribution\n- \\(0 &lt; k &lt; 1\\): bias toward lower-mass companions\n- \\(k &gt; 1\\): bias toward higher-mass (twin-like) companions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n⟨0.9 ∧ 1.0⟩\n⟨0.8 ∧ 0.9⟩\n⟨1.2 ∧ 1.5⟩\n≈ 1.2\nHigh twin fraction; modest upward skew reproduces near-equal masses.\n\n\nF\n⟨0.7 ∧ 0.9⟩\n⟨0.6 ∧ 0.8⟩\n⟨1.1 ∧ 1.3⟩\n≈ 1.0\nSlight bias toward smaller companions, but twins still possible.\n\n\nG\n⟨0.6 ∧ 0.8⟩\n⟨0.5 ∧ 0.8⟩\n⟨1.0 ∧ 1.2⟩\n≈ 0.8\nDistribution roughly flat; mild downward bias reproduces the DM91 “flat or falling” trend.\n\n\nK\n⟨0.4 ∧ 0.7⟩\n⟨0.5 ∧ 0.8⟩\n⟨1.0 ∧ 1.1⟩\n≈ 0.7\nClearly skewed toward smaller secondaries; use p ≈ 0.6∧0.8 to get that fall-off.\n\n\nM\n⟨0.2 ∧ 0.5⟩\n⟨0.5 ∧ 0.7⟩\n⟨1.0 ∧ 1.1\n≈ 0.6\nStrongly bottom-heavy distribution; small-q companions common.\n\n\n\nHow to read this table - The “lower-bias” column gives a reasonable p range if you want your generator to prefer small companions. - The “upper-bias” column gives values that push draws upward (more “twin-like” systems). - The “typical neutral value” is the mid-case consistent with observed distributions. #### Limiting Eccentricity (\\(\\bar{e}\\)) For close-binaries, the two stars should never approach closer than \\(T_{min} = 0.10\\) AU (ideally \\(0.15\\) AU). The eccentricity of the system which forces this limit can be calculated by: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{e} = \\dfrac{T_{max} - 0.100}{T_{max} + 0.100}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] - \\(ē\\) (e-bar) is the largest system eccentricity that can be used with a given \\(T_{max}\\) , while ensuring that \\(T_{min} ≥ 0.100\\).\nIf you know what eccentricity you want the system to have and need to figure out the minimum maximum separation \\(T_{max}\\) that will maintain \\(T_{min} ≥ 0.100\\) AU, you can calculate it by: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT_{max} ≥ 0.100\\left(\\dfrac{1 + \\bar{e}}{1 - \\bar{e}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] ### The Period–Eccentricity Relation\n\n20.1.0.1 1. Observed Pattern\nEmpirically, binary systems trace a clear trend:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime\nTypical Period P\nTypical Eccentricity e\nBehavior\n\n\n\n\nShort-period\nP ≲ 10 days\ne ≈ 0\nNearly circular\n\n\nIntermediate\n10 – 10³ days\ne rises from 0 → 0.6\nMixed circular / elliptical\n\n\nWide\nP ≳ 10³\nBroad scatter, e often 0.6–0.9\nDynamically “hot”\n\n\n\nThis relation has been confirmed repeatedly—from Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) and Raghavan et al. (2010) to Moe & Di Stefano (2017) and modern Gaia DR3 samples.\n\n\n20.1.0.2 2. Physical Cause — Tidal Circularization\nClose binaries experience tidal friction: each star raises bulges on its companion.\nFriction within those bulges converts orbital energy into heat, draining the system’s eccentricity.\nCircularization timescale roughly scales as \\[\nt_{circ} \\propto \\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{a}}{R}\\right)^8 \\propto P^{\\frac{16}{3}}\n\\]\nso even a modest change in separation produces a huge difference in damping time.\nSystems that are young and close become circular long before wide pairs even notice tides.\n\n\n20.1.0.3 3. Residual Eccentricities and Anomalies\n\n“Twin” binaries (nearly equal-mass, short-period) are most circularized.\n\nEccentric short-period outliers often show evidence of a third companion pumping eee through Kozai–Lidov cycles.\n\nPost-mass-transfer pairs can re-acquire modest eccentricity as mass loss changes the potential.\n\n\n\n20.1.0.4 4. Approximate Empirical Envelope\nFor solar-type primaries, the upper bound of observed eccentricities can be sketched as \\[\ne_{max} \\simeq 1 - \\left(\\frac{P_{circ}}{P}\\right)^\\frac{2}{3}\n\\] with \\(P_{circ} \\sim 10\\) days days for main-sequence systems in the solar neighborhood.\nBeyond \\(P \\approx 1000\\) days, the envelope flattens near \\(e_{max} \\approx 0.9\\).\n\n\n20.1.1 🧭 Summary Insight\n\nShort orbits → tidal geometry dominates → circular.\nLong orbits → gravitational memory dominates → eccentric.\nThe period–eccentricity curve is the fossilized record of each system’s early interactions and subsequent tidal sculpting.",

    "text": "22.1 Roche Limit\nMajor Topics:\n- Defines the Roche Limit as the critical distance from a massive primary where tidal forces exceed a secondary body’s self-gravitational cohesion.\n- Explains that within this radius, a self-gravitating body cannot remain intact and will be tidally disrupted into fragments or rings.\n- Provides the classical expression for the Roche Limit:\n\\[\n  R_r \\approx 2.44\\,R_p\n  \\left(\n    \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_s}\n  \\right)^{\\!\\tfrac{1}{3}}\n  \\]\nwhere the ratio of the primary’s to the satellite’s mean density determines the disruption distance.\n- Distinguishes between rigid and fluid satellites:\n- Rigid (rocky) bodies can survive closer to the primary (≈1.5–2 \\(R_p\\)).\n- Fluid (icy or deformable) bodies are disrupted farther out (≈2.5 \\(R_p\\)).\n- Emphasizes that the Roche Limit describes the tidal destruction boundary, whereas the Roche Lobe and Hill Sphere describe gravitational domains of stability.\n- Summarizes the three related regimes:\n| Regime | Controlling Effect | Outcome |\n|:–|:–|:–|\n| Roche Lobe | gravitational balance between companions | mass exchange |\n| Roche Limit | tidal shear exceeds self-gravity | body disruption |\n| Hill Sphere | self-gravity exceeds external tides | stable satellite region |\n- Clarifies that the Roche Limit applies in high mass-ratio systems (planet–moon, star–planet), while the Roche Lobe governs comparable-mass binaries.\n- Notes that tidal disruption at or within the Roche Limit can produce rings, debris disks, or accretion streams, depending on the system’s scale and composition.\nKey Terms & Symbols:\n- \\(R_r\\) — Roche Limit radius (distance from primary center).\n- \\(R_p\\) — primary’s radius.\n- \\(\\rho_p\\), \\(\\rho_s\\) — mean densities of primary and secondary.\n- Tidal Gradient — differential gravitational force across the secondary.\n- Rigid / Fluid Satellite — composition-dependent resistance to disruption.\nCross-Check Notes:\n- Complements Roche Lobe Geometry and Hill Sphere as the third gravitational-boundary construct.\n- Provides the theoretical framework for ring formation, tidal capture, and disruption cascades.\n- Serves as a transition from binary gravitational dynamics to planetary ring and debris-disk modeling in later sections.\nThe Roche Limit marks the distance from a massive primary at which the tidal gradient across a secondary body equals the secondary’s own gravitational cohesion. Inside this limit, a self-gravitating satellite can no longer remain intact; it is tidally disrupted into fragments or rings.\nFor a rigid satellite of density \\(\\rho_s\\) orbiting a primary of density \\(\\rho_p\\) and radius \\(R_p\\):\n\\[\nR_r \\approx 2.44\\,R_p\n\\left(\n  \\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_s}\n\\right)^{\\!\\tfrac{1}{3}}\n\\] Where: - \\(R_r\\) = Roche Limit radius (measured from the primary’s center)\n- \\(R_p\\) = primary’s radius\n- \\(\\rho_p\\) = primary’s mean density\n- \\(\\rho_s\\) = satellite’s mean density",
