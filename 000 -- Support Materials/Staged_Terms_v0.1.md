### Euclidean Algorithm (exolex)
- A method for finding the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of two integers by repeated division with remainder.  
- Useful in WCB for simplifying ratios or detecting integer relationships in synodic and resonance systems.  
- Process: divide the larger number by the smaller, replace, repeat until remainder = 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.  
- Provides the mathematical underpinning for calculating **LCM** in the **Synodial Epoch** framework.
