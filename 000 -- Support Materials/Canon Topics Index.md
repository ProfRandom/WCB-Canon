### ✓ Classification Rule — The Monobody Condition.md
**Major Topics:**

- Distinction between **physical properties** (m, ρ) and **emergent properties** (g, vₑ, r).

  1. Mass (m), Uncompressed Density (ρ) — composition-driven.  
  2. Surface Gravity (g), Escape Velocity (vₑ) — experiential.  
  3. Radius (r) — emergent.  
- Validation: computed values for g, vₑ, and r from Geotic-range m and ρ remain within acceptable Geotic bounds.

- Replaces recursive compression modeling with a WCB-friendly simplification.  
- Geotic range justification links to habitability framework.  
- Integrates with prior note **Example: When Good Values Go Bad** (edge-case validation).

- r = radius (Earth: 6371 km).  
- ρ = density (Earth: 5.514 g/cm³).
