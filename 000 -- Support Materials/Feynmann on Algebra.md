  
My cousin at that time was three years older and was in high school and was having considerable difficulty with 
algebra and had a tutor come and I was allowed to sit in the corner while the tutor would try to teach my cousin algebra.

So, problems like 2x plus 7 is equal to 15, and you're trying to figure out what x is, and I said, "You mean four?", and he said, "Yeah, but you did it by arithmatic; you have to do it by algebra."

And that's why my cousin was never able to do it, because he didn't understand what he was supposed to do.

Fortunately, I learned algebra not by going to school but by knowing the whole idea was to find out what X was and it didn't make any difference how you did it.  There's no such thing as "you don't do it by arithmetic, you do it by algebra"; that was a false thing that they had invented in school so that children who had to study algebra could all pass it.

They invented a set of rules which, if you followed them without thinking, could produce the answer: subtract 7 from both sides; if you have a multiplier, divide both sides by the multiplier, and so on.  A series of steps by which you could get the answer *if you didn't understand what you were trying to do*.

When I was writing this guide, I kept recalling Richard Feynman’s story about his cousin, who was told he couldn’t solve an equation by arithmetic — he had to “do it by algebra.” He never succeeded, because he was taught the steps without the purpose. Feynman, meanwhile, saw that the real point was simple: find out what 𝑥 is, and it doesn’t matter how you do it. This guide follows that principle. I’ll show you formulas, but I’ll also show you the geometry, the story, the intuition behind them — so you know not just how to calculate, but what the result means for the world you’re making. In this guide, you won’t just know the numerical magnitude of 𝑥;  you’ll know what 𝑥 *is* — what it means for your world.
