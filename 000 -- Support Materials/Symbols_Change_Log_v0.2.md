# 📝 Symbols Change Log v0.2 — Worlds by the Numbers

This log tracks deprecated or altered symbols.  
New/active symbols are in the Symbols Index; this file preserves editorial history.  

---

## Synodial Framework
- **Y0 → Y₀** (`Y0` → `Y_0`)  
  Reason: Standardized to subscript notation for clarity.  

---

## Constants & Units
- **Year notation**: sometimes abbreviated as “a” (Latin *annum*). WCB standard = **yr**.  
- **Month notation**: “m” deprecated (conflict with minutes, meters, mass). WCB standard = **n**.  
- **Golden Ratio**: previously given only as φ; now clarified as **φ (0.618…)** and **Φ (1.618…)**.  
- **Byr vs Ga**: both appear in legacy sources. WCB standard = **Ga** (Giga-annum).

## General Guidelines
- Subscripts use underscore form (Xₐ).  
- Avoid inline numerals unless canonical (e.g., CO2).  
- Retired symbols and notations will be recorded here with replacements.
