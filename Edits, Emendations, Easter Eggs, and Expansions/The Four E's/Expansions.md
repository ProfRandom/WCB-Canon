Re: [[Classification Rule — The Monobody Condition ✓]]

This note is a solid foundation, but it points to places that deserve fuller treatment elsewhere:
- **–mo (Suffix) Entry** → expansion explaining Basri’s original _planemo_ and your reinterpretation of –mo as “monobody.”
- **Monobody Ontotypes (Umbrella)** → overview note enumerating planemo/intermo/stellamo/etc. with cross-links. This one could serve as the kernel, but the expansion would add Basri credit + system diagram.   
- **System vs Object Clarification** → might warrant a sidebar elaborating the difference between barycentric modeling convenience vs ontological status.

Re: [[An Extended Classification ✓]]

- **Conformations Section**: This deserves a proper write-up as a formal taxonomy tree under the “Composition” part of the book. Right now it’s sketched; readers would benefit from a table or diagram linking Lithic/Astatic/Aetheric → subtypes.    
- **Earthlike Planemos**: At the end, you note the lack of a standard definition of “Earth-like.” That’s a seed for a sidebar/expansion: _“Defining Earthlike: Physical vs Environmental Criteria.”_

Re: [[Ontosomic Expansion of "Life" Concepts ✓]]

- **Life Spectrum Sidebar:** Expand the binary → spectrum idea (non-life → quasi-life → life).    
- **Ethics Sidebar:** Terraforming as genocide, humans as galactic invasive species. Those deserve to be pulled into an explicit sidebar so they’re not buried mid-note.    
- **Case Studies:** A couple of example planemos (Titan → methanic ontosomics, Venus-like → nitric-oxide ontosomics).
