# Superhabitable Planemos
René Heller and John Armstrong in 2014 proposed that “superhabitable planets” might exist in other star systems. These would be planemos having physical characteristics, orbital parameters, and attributes of their host star(s) which would all combine to make them far more amenable to the appearance and success of highly diverse biospheres than even Earth has proven to be. Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean that they’d be "superhabitable" for humanoid (or even Earth-like) life!

Heller and Armstrong reasoned that these planemos would be most likely found orbiting stars with masses in the range of ⟨0.359 ∧ 0.817⟩⊙ (spectral classes M0 – G9). This is because these stars have longer lifetimes than the Sun (between ⟨1.656 ∧ 12.934⟩⊙), and thus planemos in their habitable zones would have a longer period during which life could appear and flourish. 

>Terrestrial planemos that are slightly more massive than Earth, that is, up to 2 or 3 M⊕, are preferably superhabitable due to the longer tectonic activity, a carbon-silicate cycle that is active on a longer timescale, enhanced magnetic shielding against cosmic and stellar high-energy radiation, their larger surface area, a smoother surface allowing for more shallow seas, their potential to retain atmospheres thicker than that of Earth, and the positive effects of non-intelligent life on a planemo’s habitability, which can be observed on Earth.”

Heller and Armstrong further narrow the range when they write: “We conclude that planets with masses up to about 2 M⊕ tend to be superhabitable from the tectonic point of view.” Also, Lena Noack and Doris Breuer had already noted earlier in 2011 that the “… propensity of plate tectonics seems to have a peak between 1 and 5 Earth masses…,”
- … with the optimum mass approximately 2.0 terran masses, and from “… a geological perspective, the optimal mass of a planemo is about 2 M⊕, so it must have a radius that keeps the density of the Earth ….”

The larger mass of these planemos lends itself to several characteristics that may be super-suitable to abundant life:
1. A thicker, heavier atmosphere (resulting from the aforementioned greater tectonic activity) that would retain more oxygen and greenhouse gasses and which would help keep the surface temperature higher, even beyond the H5 orbit of the system;
2. A larger liquid core, which would lead to a stronger magnetic field, excellent for defending the planemo against potentially more active host stars and also lead to higher internal heat;
3. Shallower oceans and lower mountains (a generally flatter geography), that could encourage much greater biodiversity than seen on Earth.

Thus, the general characteristics for these planemos comprises:
- Mass: ⟨2.0 ∧ 3.0⟩⊕, with a preference for the lower end of the range.
- Radius: ⟨1.260 ∧ 1.442⟩⨁, to maintain a density (and gravity) similar to Earth.
- Oceans: the percentage of surface area covered by oceans should be Earth-like (≈ 71%), but more distributed, without large continuous land masses. The oceans should be shallow; the host star’s light then will penetrate easier through the water and will reach the submarine fauna and flora, stimulating an abundance of life within lakes, seas, and oceans.
- Orbital Distance: the planemo should orbit closer to the center of its system's habitable zone(s) than Earth does in our Solar System; remember, Earth is located within the inner 11.9% of the Sun's conservative habitable zone and 24.5% of the optimistic habitable zone. In the Solar System, the center of the optimistic habitable zone lies at 1.26 AU and the central orbit of the conservative habitable zone lies at 1.16 AU.
- Temperature: the surface temperature should average about 25 °C (77 °F).
- Atmosphere: somewhat denser than Earth's and with a higher concentration of oxygen (> 20.95%). That will make life more abundant (and individual lifeforms larger on average).
- Stellar Classification and Age: the host star(s) should be smaller and cooler than the Sun, in the mass range ⟨0.359 ∧ 0.817⟩⊙M (spectral classes M0 – G9), and, therefore, necessarily older than the Sun’s 4.5 billion years, but with a current age younger than 7 billion years.
