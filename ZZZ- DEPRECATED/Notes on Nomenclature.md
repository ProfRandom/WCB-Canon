# ðŸ”¢ Numerical Precision and Rounding Conventions

Unless otherwise noted, decimal values in _Worldcrafting 101_ are expressed to **three decimal places**, including trailing zeros (e.g., âŸ¨1.000 âˆ§ 0.500âŸ©. This standard ensures clarity and consistency across all parameter outputs and computational examples.

In some cases, a **fourth decimal place** is included â€” **not** to imply increased precision, but to clarify the **rounding direction** of the third decimal digit:

- `0.5445` indicates that the third-place digit (`4`) would round **up** to `0.545`, making the standard value a **slight overstatement**.
    
- `0.5454` shows that rounding to `0.545` is a **safe approximation**, as the third-place digit has **not been rounded up**.

"Gaean" is a composite designator for planemos identical to Earth in all particulars except land-to-water surface ratio, rotation rate, and/or orbital period, and fall under the Terrean planemo type. Axial tilt can also vary within Earth's standard range of 22.1Â° - 24.5Â°. Since orbital period may vary, orbital eccentricity may, as well.

- **Geotics**: Earth-cognate planemos with differences that still allow for human habitation with technological aid (habitable).
 - **Rheatics**: Earth-analogsâ€”_hospitable_ planemos nearly identical to Earth in composition, surface conditions, and other major characteristics, except for minor variations in Characteristics and Attributes.   
 - **Gaeans**: "Hospitable" Earth-correlatesâ€”planemos that are **compositionally identical** to Earth in mass, density, radius, surface gravity, atmospheric composition, and overall environment, with potential variations in surface features, climate, or orbital dynamics.
    
Mansible: occupiable, tenantable, but not inherently hospitable or habitable.
