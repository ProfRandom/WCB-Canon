# Glossary of Thesiastics

**Thesiastics** _(n.)_

> /ˌθiziˈæstɪks/  
> The discipline of world-setting: the synthesis of structural systems, symbolic meaning, and contextual coherence into a fictional world. From Greek _thesis_ (θέσις), “a placing or proposition.”

---

**Thesiast** _(n.)_

> One who engages in thesiastics. A worldbuilder by craft, choice, or obsession.

---

**Enthesiast** _(n.)_

> A joyful or compulsive thesiast; one who takes irrepressible delight in the generative act of worldcrafting. Often found lost in topography, orbital diagrams, or comparative alphabets.  
> _See also:_ "lore architect", "cosmogenic maximalist", "inhabitant of their own draft folder."

---

**Numerothesiastics** _(n.)_

> The quantitative branch of thesiastics. Concerned with the mathematical, physical, astronomical, and systemic underpinnings of worlds.  
> _Abbreviated:_ **Tₙ**

---

**Mirandothesiastics** _(n.)_

> The qualitative branch of thesiastics. Concerned with myth, meaning, culture, aesthetics, and affective resonance.  
> _Abbreviated:_ **Tₘ**

---

**Tₙ / Tₘ**

> Subscript notation used throughout W101 to refer respectively to numerothesiastic and mirandothesiastic domains.


# Ontosomics
## 🧬 What Is Ontosomics?

**Ontosomics** is the symbolic and classificatory study of _life-relevant planemo characteristics_, with an emphasis on environmental, structural, and energetic conditions that affect **habitability** or **biosignature potential**.

> **From Greek**: _ontos_ (being, existence) + _sōma_ (body) + _-ics_ (systematic study)

### 🔍 Working Definition (WBN)

> **Ontosomics** is the study of planemo and environmental features as they relate to the possibility, probability, or support of life — whether Earthlike, analogous, or entirely exotic.

It operates as the **biospheric inference layer** in WBN’s planemo modeling system — situated between:

- **Astrophysics** (e.g. stellar irradiance, orbital parameters)    
- **Geophysics** (e.g. mass, magnetosphere, atmosphere)    
- **Exobiology** (life models, chemistry, thermodynamics)

### 📚 Ontosomics ≠ Biology

Ontosomics does not presume or require biology as we know it — instead, it defines the **envelopes and thresholds** within which life _might_ emerge, persist, or adapt.

It is **not** a guarantee of life — only of **viability zones**, **environmental plausibility**, and **symbolically tractable models**.
