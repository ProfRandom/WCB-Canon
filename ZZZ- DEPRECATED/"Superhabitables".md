“**Superhabitables** might be considered **mega-ontosomic** — worlds where the conditions for the _emergence, proliferation, and persistence_ of life are _enhanced_ — in part due to **stronger and longer-lasting magnetospheres**, among other factors.”


René Heller and John Armstrong* in 2014 proposed that “superhabitable planets” might exist in
other star systems. These would be planemos having physical characteristics, orbital parameters, and attributes of their host star(s) which would all combine to make them far more amenable to the appearance and success of highly diverse biospheres than even Earth has proven to be. Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean that they’d be superhabitable for humanoid (or even Earth-like) life!
Heller and Armstrong reasoned that these planemos would be most likely found orbiting stars with masses in the range of [0.359, 0.817] solar (spectral classes M0 – G9). This is because these stars have longer lifetimes than the Sun (between 1.656 and 12.934] solar), and thus planemos in their habitable zones would have a longer period during which life could appear and flourish. They specfied that the Sun’s mass is the upper limit for stars hosting superhabitable worlds.†
“Terrestrial planemos that are slightly more massive than Earth, that is, up to 2 or 3 M⊕, are preferably superhabitable due to the longer tectonic activity, a carbon-silicate cycle that is active on a longer timescale, enhanced magnetic shielding against cosmic and stellar high-energy radiation, their larger surface area, a smoother surface allowing for more shallow seas, their potential to retain atmospheres thicker than that of Earth, and the positive effects of non-intelligent life on a planemo’s habitability, which can be observed on Earth.”‡ [emphasis added]

> A superhabitable world with **mass ~1.6⨁**, **density ~0.9⨁**, and **radius ~1.4⨁** would likely have:
> - Gravity ≈ ⟨1.2 ∧ 1.3⟩⨁
> - Tectonics that last **longer than Earth’s**
> - A magnetosphere that persists beyond 5 Gyr
> > - Surface conditions favorable to broad, shallow seas and stable landmasses
> 
This is a planemo **sweet spot** — a true **mega-ontosomic** candidate.
