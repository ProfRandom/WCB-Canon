## 📌 Notes
- Despite suspicion of partial rewrites, Vault shows **no dedicated coverage** for orbit design methods.  
- Possible that relevant material is embedded in **Stars module** (stellar zones, thermozones) rather than orbit design folder.  
- Orbit Design Methods may need to be **reconstructed almost from scratch**, with integration of new star/planemo framework.
