## Git as Logos, Index as Mythos
- *“Git only tracks which edition of the dictionary sits on the shelf; the Index tells you what words live inside it.”*  
- Git provides **logosic record** (timestamps, versions, line diffs).  
- WBN indices/snapshots provide **mythosic meaning** (what terms were added, how frameworks evolved, why changes matter).  
- Reflection: workflow itself mirrors the logosic/mythosic integration at the core of worldmaking.
