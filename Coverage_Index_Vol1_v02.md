# 📊 Coverage Index v0.2 — Volume 1: Fundamentals and The Big Picture

Mapping of the legacy PDF sections against current Vault (WorldCrafting101-DEV, 216 files).  
Status: ✔ Revised | ❓ Partial | ✖ Not Yet Revisited  

---

## 1 — Ellipses and Orbits
- **Vault Matches:**  
  - `Modules/009 - Sidebars/Ellipse Parameters and Equations.md` → covers ellipse geometry and math.  
- **Status:** ❓ Partial — Mathematical treatment exists, but not yet tied into orbital relevance/context. Needs rewrite linking math to planetary orbits.  

## 2 — Orbits: Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
- **Vault Matches:** None found.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — Kepler’s Laws not yet covered in Vault.  

## 3 — The Hill Sphere and The Roche Limit
- **Vault Matches:** None found.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — No Hill Sphere / Roche material yet in Vault.  

## 4 — Orbital Resonances and Synodic Period
- **Vault Matches:**  
  - `Canon Files/Orbital Resonances/Orbital Resonances 1 — Mean Motion Resonance.md`  
  - `Canon Files/Orbital Resonances/Orbital Resonances 2 — The Synodian.md`  
  - `Canon Files/Orbital Resonances/Orbital Resonances 3 — The Synodial Epoch.md`  
- **Status:** ✔ Revised/Expanded — Substantial new coverage (mean motion resonance, synodion, synodial epoch).  

## 5 — Orbital Libration Points
- **Vault Matches:** None found.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — No Lagrange/libration coverage yet.  

## 6 — How Big and How Bright
- **Vault Matches:** None found.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — Needs rewrite on planetary/star scale brightness/size.  

## 7 — Milankovitch Cycles
- **Vault Matches:** None found.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — No Vault coverage of orbital climate cycles.  

## 8 — The Universe In a Shoebox
- **Vault Matches:** None found.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — No Vault coverage of scaling/universe model.  

## 9 — Galaxy Habitability
- **Vault Matches:** None found.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — No Vault coverage. Consider if this belongs in new scope.

## 📌 Notes
- Of 9 major sections, only **Orbital Resonances/Synodic Period** has been significantly revised.  
- **Ellipses**: covered mathematically, not narratively. Needs integration with orbital context.  
- **Kepler/Hill/Roche** → still pending.  
- **Milankovitch, Universe in a Shoebox, Galaxy Habitability** → potential scope question (are these essential in WBN 2e?).
