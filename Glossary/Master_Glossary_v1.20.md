# Worlds by the Numbers â€” Master Glossary v1.20

This glossary collects **neolexes** (newly coined terms), **exolexes** (borrowed/adapted from external disciplines), and **insulexes** (internal conventions specific to WCB).  
Version 1.20 adds 26 new terms since v1.19.

## ðŸ“— Neolexes (WCB coinages)

- **N-conjunction (N-orbiton systems)** â€” Alignment of N orbitons in a system; technically possible but practically impossible beyond three due to eccentricity and coplanarity requirements.  
- **Synodion (Î£)** â€” The interval between successive alignments (synodia) of two orbitons.  
- **Synodos (pl. synodoi)** â€” The moment of alignment/closest approach between two orbitons.  
- **Centron (CÌ‡)** â€” The central body in an orbital system around which orbitons revolve.  
- **Orbiton** â€” Any body orbiting the centron.  
- **Base angle (B^Î¸)** â€” Reference alignment angle (at Tâ‚€) from which successive synodia are measured.  
- **Minor unit angle (Î¸_Î±)** â€” Angular distance traveled by the outer orbiton in one base time unit.  
- **Major unit angle (Î¸_Î²)** â€” Angular distance traveled by the inner orbiton in one base time unit.  
- **Orbiton difference angle (Î¸_Î”)** â€” Difference in angular motion per unit time between two orbitons.  
- **Synodial fraction (F_Î£)** â€” Fractional orbit completed during a synodion.  
- **Synodial angle (Î˜)** â€” The angular offset at which a given synodos occurs.  
- **Synodial lag angle (Î”Î˜)** â€” The shortfall angle between successive synodia.  
- **Synodial instance angle (Î˜Ì‚)** â€” Angular location of a specific numbered synodos.  
- **Synodial Epoch (Î¥)** â€” Interval after which a synodion recurs at the base angle, completing a full cycle.  
- **Epochal Aggregate (Î¥â‚€)** â€” Total elapsed time of one synodial epoch.  
- **Epochal Interval (Î¨)** â€” Number of synodia occurring within a synodial epoch.  
- **Quarter Synodial Epoch (Î¥/4)** â€” One fourth of a synodial epoch, yielding cardinal synodoi.  
- **Cardinal Synodoi** â€” Synodoi that fall on cardinal angles (90Â°, 180Â°, 270Â°).  
- **Quarter Epochal Interval (Î¨/4)** â€” Number of common synodoi between successive cardinal synodoi.  
- **Epochal Major Complement (Î¥Î±)** â€” Number of orbits completed by the outer orbiton per synodial epoch.  
- **Epochal Minor Complement (Î¥Î²)** â€” Number of orbits completed by the inner orbiton per synodial epoch.

## ðŸ“˜ Exolexes (borrowed / adapted terms)

- **Mean Motion Resonance** â€” Orbital resonance where orbital periods of two bodies are in a ratio of small integers.  
- **First-order resonance** â€” Resonance where the integer ratio difference = 1 (e.g., 2:1, 3:2).  
- **Second-order resonance** â€” Resonance where the integer ratio difference = 2 (e.g., 5:3, 3:1).  
- **Synodic Period** â€” Standard astronomical term for the recurrence interval of alignments.  
- **Commensurate** â€” Having a common measure; in orbital mechanics, periods that can be expressed as a ratio of integers.

## ðŸ“™ Insulexes (WCB internal conventions)

- **Primary / secondary / tertiary hierarchy (by mass)** â€” Rule that system members are ranked by relative mass (not radius or volume) when assigning labels such as primary, secondary, tertiary.
