## New in v1.211

### Fractional Distance Asymmetry (Ḋ)
- **Definition**: Dimensionless measure of the fractional difference in orbital distance between periastron and apastron for a secondary orbiting a primary (M₂ ⋘ M₁).
  $$
  \dot{D} = \frac{R_{max}}{R_{min}} - 1 = \frac{2e}{1-e}
  $$
- **Usage**: Expresses how much closer a planemo is to its star at periastron compared to apastron; useful shorthand for seasonal asymmetry.
- **Examples**:
  - Earth ($e=0.0167$): Ḋ ≈ 0.034 → 3.4% closer at periastron.
  - Rosetta ($e=0.05$): Ḋ ≈ 0.105 → 10.5% closer at periastron.
- **Notes**:
  - Sometimes notated as β in algebraic derivations; however, β is reserved in astrophysics for unrelated ratios (e.g., radiation pressure ratio).
  - ß (Eszett) appeared in draft notes but is deprecated in WCB canon to avoid confusion with β.
  - Legacy symbols rₚ, rₐ (perihelion/aphelion distances) should be replaced with Rₘᵢₙ/Rₘₐₓ in canon.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.211.

### Clarification of 𝒜 (Semimajor Axis)
- **Definition**: 𝒜 is the average orbital separation between two bodies.
- **Usage**: In planemo–star systems, 𝒜 corresponds to the orbital semimajor axis.
- **Notes**: Use 𝒜 consistently to avoid confusion with plain "a" variables.

### Deprecated in v1.211
- **ß (Eszett)** — appeared in draft notes as a placeholder for distance asymmetry. Deprecated to avoid confusion with β and with canonical Ḋ.

## New in v1.212

### SANC Principle (SANC)
- **Definition**: Acronym for *Science-Adjacent, No Calculus* — the guiding boundary of WCB. It means that content remains scientifically rigorous while accessible without calculus.
- **Usage**:
  - Sets the pedagogical expectation: algebra, geometry, and trigonometry are fair game; calculus is not required.
  - Shapes notation and presentation so that concepts are approachable for technically inclined worldbuilders.
- **Clarifications**:
  - *Sufficient and Necessary Constructs* expresses the **design filter**: include what’s required for worldbuilding utility, but omit what isn’t.
  - *Simple, Approximate, Notationally Clear* expresses the **presentation filter**: keep math streamlined, allow approximations, and use symbols consistently.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.212.

## New in v1.213

### Ring Shadows
- **Definition**: Regions of reduced stellar illumination cast onto a planemo’s surface by its planetary ring system.
- **Usage**: Important for modeling local climate effects, seasonal variability, and habitability of worlds with dense rings.
- **Notes**: Ring shadows vary in intensity, duration, and latitude depending on ring geometry and axial tilt. Subtypes include *Partial Occlusion*, *Double Crossing*, *No Occlusion*, and *Never Entirely Occluded*.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.213.

### Partial Occlusion (Ring Shadow Scenario)
- **Definition**: A ring-shadow condition where the Sun (primary star) is partially obscured by the ring, creating diminished but nonzero illumination.
- **Usage**: Produces twilight-like effects that can alter local climate and diurnal rhythms.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.213.

### Double Crossing (Ring Shadow Scenario)
- **Definition**: A ring-shadow condition where the Sun’s apparent path crosses the ring plane twice during the day, causing two distinct shadowing events.
- **Usage**: Leads to complex daily light/dark cycles, potentially with cooling periods between warm intervals.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.213.

### No Occlusion (Ring Shadow Scenario)
- **Definition**: A ring-shadow condition where the Sun never intersects the ring plane from the observer’s location; the ring casts no shadow on that latitude.
- **Usage**: Indicates unaffected regions outside the ring-shadow zone.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.213.

### Never Entirely Occluded (Ring Shadow Scenario)
- **Definition**: A ring-shadow condition where the Sun is always partially visible, even at maximum ring overlap; full eclipse never occurs.
- **Usage**: Creates long-duration twilight dimming but avoids total darkness.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.213.

### Declination (Solar)
- **Definition**: The angular distance of the star above or below the planemo’s celestial equator, varying with obliquity and orbital position.
- **Usage**: Critical parameter in determining the latitude and timing of ring-shadow events.
- **Notes**: An established astronomical term; WCB canon emphasizes its role in seasonal climate and ring-shadow geometry.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.213.

  - *vₑ* (escape velocity)
- **Usage**: A shorthand category for **physical conformation** of monobodies.

  - Distinct from *habitable*, *parahabitable*, *hospitable*, *xenotic*, or *exotic*.
  - Unrelated to **animogenic** (life-producing) or **animosustent** (life-sustaining) qualities.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.214.

### Earth-like (modifier)
- **Definition**: Qualifier indicating similarity to Earth’s **physical conformation** in bulk properties (*m, r, ρ, g, vₑ*).
- **Usage**:
  - “Earth-like planemo” → a terrestrial-type body in terms of mass, radius, density, etc.
  - “Earth-like density” → shorthand for ρ ≈ ρ⊕.
- **Notes**:
  - Does **not** equate to *habitable* or *life-supporting*.
  - Unrelated to **animogenic** or **animosustent** qualities.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.214.

## New in v1.215

### Harmonic Period (H)
- **Definition**: The time interval over which two independent cycles align in periodicity.
  $$
  H = \dfrac{P_1 \times P_2}{|P_1 - P_2|}
  $$
- **Usage**: Describes the alignment interval between repeating cycles, such as between the solar day and sidereal day, or other cyclic astronomical phenomena.
- **Notes**:
  - Mathematically identical to the **generic synodic period formula**.
  - *Harmonic period* is the abstract/general term for any two cycles.
  - *Synodic period* is the traditional astronomical term when applied to orbital or rotational alignments.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.215.
