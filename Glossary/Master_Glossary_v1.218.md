### Fractional Distance Asymmetry (Ḋ)
- **Definition**: Dimensionless measure of the fractional difference in orbital distance between periastron and apastron for a secondary orbiting a primary (M₂ ⋘ M₁).
  $$
  \dot{D} = \frac{R_{max}}{R_{min}} - 1 = \frac{2e}{1-e}
  $$
- **Usage**: Expresses how much closer a planemo is to its star at periastron compared to apastron; useful shorthand for seasonal asymmetry.
- **Examples**:
  - Earth ($e=0.0167$): Ḋ ≈ 0.034 → 3.4% closer at periastron.
  - Rosetta ($e=0.05$): Ḋ ≈ 0.105 → 10.5% closer at periastron.
- **Notes**:
  - Sometimes notated as β in algebraic derivations; however, β is reserved in astrophysics for unrelated ratios (e.g., radiation pressure ratio).
  - ß (Eszett) appeared in draft notes but is deprecated in WCB canon to avoid confusion with β.
  - Legacy symbols rₚ, rₐ (perihelion/aphelion distances) should be replaced with Rₘᵢₙ/Rₘₐₓ in canon.
- **Status**: Canon as of v1.211.

- **Status**: Canon as of v1.213.

### Never Entirely Occluded (Ring Shadow Scenario)
- **Definition**: A ring-shadow condition where the Sun is always partially visible, even at maximum ring overlap; full eclipse never occurs.

- **C** — *Sidereal Chronum (WCB-specific)*

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Appears in: ✓ Approximating Season Lengths.md (uses C explicitly).  
- Ensure $P$ and $C$ are not conflated in glossary or equations.  

---

### Core Parameter Precedence
- **Definition**: Hierarchical convention for deriving planemo parameters in WCB.

  2. Surface Gravity (g) and Escape Velocity (vₑ) — experiential properties.  
  3. Radius (r) — emergent property.  
- **Cross-Check Notes**:  
  - ρ is always treated as *uncompressed density* in WCB.

  - Where *a* = semi-major axis, *b* = semi-minor axis.  

- **Formula (Oblate Spheroid)**:  
  $f = \dfrac{a - b}{a}$  
  - Where *a* = equatorial radius, *b* = polar radius.  

- **Properties**:  
  - f = 0 for a circle/sphere.  
  - Increases with eccentricity (ellipse) or oblateness (spheroid).  
  - Purely geometric — distinct from orbital eccentricity (e), though related.  

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Introduced in **✓ Ellipse Parameters and Equations.md** (ellipse context).  
- Anticipated in future notes on planetary rotation and oblate spheroids.  
- Ensure consistent symbol use across both 2D orbital geometry and 3D body-shape contexts.
