- **Thermozone Limit Notation (H₀–H₅)** — Reference shorthand for thermozone boundaries.  
- **Perannual Orbit ($\mathcal{P}$)** — Orbital distance where a planemo completes one sidereal Earth year (365.256 days).  
- **Solar Analogs** — Stars whose perannual orbits fall within ⟨0.500–4.850⟩ AU (F2–K9).  
- **Solar Cognates** — Stars whose perannual orbits fall within ⟨0.750–1.770⟩ AU (F7.62–K1.11).  
- **Solar Twins** — Stars whose perannual orbits fall within ⟨0.950–1.385⟩ AU (G1.04–G7.73).  
- **Orbital Habitability Index (OHI)** — Scalar measure of an orbit’s biological viability (0.00–1.00). Max = 1.00 at N.  
- **Orbital Interval (I)** — Ratio of successive orbital radii.  
- **Orbital Gap (G)** — Difference in orbital distance between successive planemos.  
- **WBN Standard Orbital Interval Range** — Adopted ⟨1.500–2.000⟩ AU for most layouts.  
- **Basal Orbit (B)** — Reference orbit for system generation, usually N or A.  
- **Intrabasal Orbit Process** — Method for generating inward orbits from a basal orbit.  
- **Extrabasal Orbit Process** — Method for generating outward orbits from a basal orbit.
- **ε₀ World** — A planemo on a perfectly circular orbit (eccentricity = 0).  
  - Consequences: no seasonal variation, constant apparent stellar size, identical day length year-round.  
  - “Seasons” are absent except as defined by external cycles (e.g., lunar months or stellar drift).
- **Anthropic Norm** — The dominant, modal state of matter and energy in the universe during the current epoch.  
  - Not the statistical average, but the **modal cluster**: where most matter and energy exist most of the time.  
  - Extreme conditions (e.g., neutron stars, black holes) may be numerous, but remain **exceptions** to this baseline.  
  - Named in resonance with the **Anthropic Principle** of cosmology (Carter 1973; Barrow & Tipler 1986), but reinterpreted in WBN to describe the **modal cosmic baseline**, not observational selection effects.  
  - Provides the baseline context for thesiastic modeling.
 - **Mediocritic Principle of State** — WBN principle that normativity is defined by modal clustering, not arithmetic mean.  
  - The “normal” state of the cosmos is that which occurs **most frequently**, not a mathematically averaged value.
- **Uncompressed Density (ρᵤ)** — WBN convention treating a planemo’s density as its intrinsic material density **ignoring gravitational self-compression**.  
  - Keeps ρ independent of m, simplifying calculations.  
  - Compression effects are minimal within the Geotic range ⟨0.5 ∧ 1.5⟩⨁, so this assumption is tolerable.  
  - **Parameter Precedence** — WBN symbolic hierarchy for planemo properties:  
  1. **Physical Constraints:** mass (m) and uncompressed density (ρ).  
  2. **Experiential Parameters:** surface gravity (g) and escape velocity (vₑ).  
  3. **Emergent Parameter:** radius (r), derived from m and ρ.  
  - Ensures consistent modeling and prioritizes physically constrained inputs first.
- **Magnetosphere Scaling Law** — WBN approximation framework for estimating planetary magnetic fields. Expressed as:  
  $B_{surf} \propto \left(\dfrac{\rho_c}{\rho_\oplus}\right)^p \times \left(\dfrac{r_c}{r_\oplus}\right)^q \times \left(\dfrac{1}{d}\right)^r$,  
  where ρ_c = core density, r_c = core radius, d = day length.  
  - Rule-of-thumb exponents: p = 1.0–1.3, q = 2.0–2.5, r = 1.0–1.5.  
  - Produces comparative models: e.g. a denser core and faster spin → stronger field.
- **Geotic Ground States** — WBN special-case solutions for planemo parameter equations when one of the five core parameters (m, ρ, g, vₑ, r) is set equal to 1.  
  - Simplifies interrelationships: e.g., if ρ = 1, then r = g = vₑ, and m = r³.  
  - If any two = 1 simultaneously, all five collapse to unity.  

- **Paramount Geotic Worlds** — Worlds with $g = 1.0⨁$, i.e. Earth-normal surface gravity.  
  - Considered the most naturally suited for unmodified human life, since 1g minimizes physiological strain and habitat adaptation requirements.
- - **Temporal Habitability (TH)** — WBN principle that a planemo’s habitability must be evaluated across stellar lifetimes, since habitable zones (and nucleal orbits) shift outward as stellar luminosity evolves.  
  - Example: Earthlike conditions are temporary; over billions of years, HZ drift renders initially habitable worlds inhospitable, while others (e.g., Mars, outer moons) may briefly pass into habitable ranges.
- **Geotic Envelope** — The formal parameter bounds that define plausibly Earthlike planemos in WBN. Expressed in Terran units (⨁):  
  - Mass (m): ⟨0.30 ∧ 3.35⟩  
  - Density (ρ): ⟨0.85 ∧ 1.25⟩  
  - Gravity (g): ⟨0.60 ∧ 1.65⟩  
  - Radius (r): ⟨0.60 ∧ 1.50⟩  
  - Escape Velocity (vₑ): ⟨0.65 ∧ 1.50⟩  
  - These limits are chosen not only from physics and biology but also through a mirandothesiastic lens, acknowledging both empirical constraints and narrative meaning.
- **Hydrospheric Balance** — WBN term for the relationship between a planemo’s total water inventory, crustal relief, and tectonic activity that determines the amount of **exposed land** versus global ocean.  
  - Identical volumes of crust and water can yield very different surface configurations depending on sea level and isostatic balance.  
  - Flooded cratons imply high water coverage and limited emergent landmasses.
