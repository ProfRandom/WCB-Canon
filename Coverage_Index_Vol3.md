# 📊 Coverage Index v0.1 — Volume 3: Planets, Worlds, and Small Star-System Bodies

Mapping of the legacy PDF sections against current Vault (WorldCrafting101-DEV, 216 files).  
Status: ✔ Revised | ❓ Partial | ✖ Not Yet Revisited  

---

## 1 — Fundamental Equations for Solid Bodies
- **Vault Matches:**  
  - `Modules/009 - Sidebars/Equations for Worldbuilders.md`  
  - `Canon Files/Main Sequence Stellar Equations of State.md` (stellar-focused but analogous style)  
- **Status:** ❓ Partial — Some mathematical frameworks exist; planetary/world equations need consolidation.  

## 2 — Mass Classification
- **Vault Matches:**  
  - `Modules/001 - Planets/1.01 — Planemo Classes.md`  
  - `Canon Files/Classification Rule — The Monobody Condition.md`  
  - `Canon Files/An Extended Classification.md`  
- **Status:** ✔ Revised/Expanded — Extensive Vault coverage of planemo classes and ontotypes.  

## 3 — Planetary Pairs
- **Vault Matches:** None.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — No current treatment of double/binary planet systems.  

## 4 — Small Star System Bodies
- **Vault Matches:** None.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — Needs coverage of asteroids, comets, dwarf planets, minor bodies.

## 📌 Notes
- Strong revision in **Mass Classification** with expanded planemo framework.  
- **Fundamental Equations** exist in fragments but need full planetary/world EOS treatment.  
- **Planetary Pairs** and **SSSBs** absent; decision point: fold into broader planemo framework, or keep distinct.
