## Obliquity Orientation ($\zeta$)

The *obliquity orientation* defines the orbital longitude where the planet’s northern hemisphere is tilted directly away from its star.  
If this occurs at **periastron**, then $\zeta = 0^\circ$.

$$
\begin{array}{l r l}
\zeta = &0^\circ & \text{Northern hemisphere tilted directly \textit{away} from the star at periastron.} \\
\zeta = &90^\circ & \text{Tilted away at one-fourth orbit \textit{after} periastron.} \\
\zeta = &180^\circ & \text{Tilted away at one-half orbit \textit{after} periastron (apastron).} \\
\zeta = &270^\circ & \text{Tilted away at three-fourths orbit \textit{after} periastron.}
\end{array}
$$

The value of $\zeta$ may be any angle from 0° to 359°, depending on the planet’s **axial precession**.

The obliquity orientation ($\zeta$) therefore acts as a **phase offset** between the orbit’s eccentric anomaly and the planet’s seasonal cycle, determining whether perihelion aligns with summer or winter in each hemisphere.
