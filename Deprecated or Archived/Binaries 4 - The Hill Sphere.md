## Hill Sphere
In any multi-body system, the **Hill sphere** defines the region around a smaller body within which its own gravity dominates over the tidal influence of a larger primaron.  Within this sphere, satellites, rings, or retained debris can maintain long-term stable orbits around the smaller body.

Conceptually, the Hill sphere is the **circum-orbital analog** of the Roche lobe:  where the Roche lobe marks the boundary between *two comparable masses*, the Hill sphere marks the boundary between a **primaron** and a **much smaller secondron**.

### Classical Formulation
For a secondron body of mass $M_2$ orbiting a much larger primaron of mass $M_1$ at semi-major axis $\alpha$, the radius of its Hill sphere is approximated by:

$$
H_r = \alpha
       \left(
         \frac{M_2}{3M_1}
       \right)^{\!\tfrac{1}{3}}
$$
Where:
- $H_r$ = Hill-sphere radius (the limit of stable satellite orbits)  
- $\alpha$ = orbital semi-major axis of the secondron about the primaron  
- $M_2$ = mass of the secondron (planet, moon, etc.)  
- $M_1$ = mass of the primaron (star, planet, etc.)

### Interpretation
- Inside $H_r$, the secondron’s gravity dominates; small bodies can orbit it stably.  
- Near or beyond $H_r$, tidal forces from the primaron destabilize those orbits.  
- The Hill sphere thus defines the **outer boundary of a planet’s satellite system** or, in stellar terms, the **limit of gravitational capture**.

### Rule of Thumb
- Long-term stable satellite orbits typically require  

$$
  r_{\text{sat}} \lesssim 0.5\,H_r
$$

  — i.e., within roughly half the Hill radius.

- For planets in circular orbits, the expression is accurate to within a few percent.
- For eccentric orbits, replace $\alpha$ with the **periapsis distance**, $\alpha(1 - e)$, to account for stronger tidal effects at closest approach.

### Comparison with Roche Lobe
- **Roche Lobe**
  - Two bodies of comparable mass (binaries).
  - Equipotential surface where gravitational and centrifugal forces balance.
  - Teardrop-shaped, asymmetric about $L_1$.
- **Hill Sphere**
  - Large primaron with small secondron (planet-moon; star-planet).
  - Distance from secondron where its gravitational influence equals the primaron's tidal force.
  - Roughly spherical for $m \ll M$.

 **Analogy:** The Roche lobe is the *shared frontier* between equals; the Hill sphere is the *personal domain* of a subordinate.

### Example — Earth’s Hill Sphere

For Earth ($M_2 = 1\,M_\oplus$) orbiting the Sun ($M_1 = 1\,M_\odot$) at $\alpha = 1\,\text{AU}$:

$$
H_r = 1\,\text{AU}
       \left(
         \frac{1/333{,}000}{3}
       \right)^{\!\tfrac{1}{3}}
     \approx 0.01\,\text{AU} \approx 1.5\times10^6\,\text{km}
$$

That comfortably encloses the Moon’s orbit ($≈ 384{,}000$ km), confirming its long-term stability.
