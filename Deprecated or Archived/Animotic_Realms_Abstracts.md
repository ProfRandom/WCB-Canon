## Abstract 1
**Major Topics:** 
- Defines **Geotic planemons** as **habitable** terrestrial-class worlds (rocky–metallic composition) where humans can survive with minimal adaptation. 
- Establishes parameter corridors wider than Gaeans but still viable for Earth-based life: 
 - Mass (m): 0.30–3.35 ⨁ 
 - Density (ρ): 0.85–1.25 ⨁ 
 - Surface Gravity (g): 0.60–1.65 ⨁ 
 - Radius (r): 0.60–1.50 ⨁ 
 - Escape Velocity (vₑ): 0.65–1.50 ⨁ 
- Emphasizes that density is tightly bounded to ensure terrestrial composition, while mass and radius are more flexible. 
- Geotics may require **atmospheric processing, infrastructure, or selective siting**, but can still yield shirtsleeve environments. 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **Geotic** — Habitable terrestrial-class planemon. 
- **m, ρ, g, r, vₑ** — Fundamental planemon parameters (Earth-relative). 
- **Marginal Earth-twins** — Near the edge of Gaean ranges. 
- **Super-Earths (high-gravity Geotics)** — Heavier but still habitable. 
- **Cooler, lighter Earthlikes** — Lower-pressure, lower-gravity variants. 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- All **Gaeans** are Geotics, but not all Geotics are Gaeans. 
- Broader corridors allow for habitability beyond strict shirtsleeve optimum. 
- Complements **Gaean** and **Gravity One Corridor** entries by defining the wider viable zone. 

## Abstract 2
**Major Topics:** 
- Defines **Gaean planemons** as the subset of Geotics that are fully **hospitable** (shirtsleeve worlds). 
- Parameter bounds: 
 - Mass (m): 0.45–1.85 ⨁ 
 - Density (ρ): 0.85–1.25 ⨁ 
 - Gravity (g): 0.90–1.10 ⨁ 
 - Radius (r): 0.70–1.30 ⨁ 
 - Escape velocity (vₑ): 0.80–1.20 ⨁ 
- Core criterion: **Earth-normal surface gravity** (±10%). 
- Introduces the **Gravity One Corridor** — the locus of mass–density pairs that yield g = 1.000 ⨁. 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **m** — Mass (⨁). 
- **ρ** — Density (⨁). 
- **g** — Surface gravity (⨁). 
- **r** — Radius (⨁). 
- **vₑ** — Escape velocity (⨁). 
- **Gravity One Corridor** — Parameter-space path yielding g = 1.000 ⨁. 
- **Gaean** — Shirtsleeve-hospitable planemon. 
- **Geotic** — Broader class of human-hospitable or parahabitable planemons. 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- All **Gaeans** are **Geotics**, but not all Geotics are Gaeans. 
- Gravity One Corridor acts as the **ideal comfort baseline**; deviations reduce biomechanical ease, increase escape energy cost, or complicate stability/terraforming. 
- About 17.7% of Geotics fall within/near this corridor. 
- Provides reference framework for distinguishing **hospitable** (Gaean) vs. merely **habitable** (Geotic) worlds. 

## Abstract 3
**Major Topics:** 
- Defines **Argeic planemons** as **parahabitable super-Earths**, favorable to robust biospheres but often inhospitable to unmodified humans. 
- Parameter corridors: 
 - Mass (m): 1.00–3.00 ⨁ 
 - Density (ρ): 0.85–1.25 ⨁ 
 - Surface Gravity (g): 0.85–1.70 ⨁ 
 - Radius (r): 0.90–1.50 ⨁ 
 - Escape Velocity (vₑ): 0.95–1.50 ⨁ 
- **Overlap with Gaeans:** ≈13.9% of Argeics fall within Gaean gravity bounds (0.9–1.1 ⨁), making them unusually favorable worlds with both Earthlike conditions and enhanced biospheric potential. 
- **Core Feature:** Larger, denser terrestrial bodies → broader climatic bands, longer tectonic–volcanic cycling, stronger magnetospheres, and more biospheric resilience (“superhabitable” qualities). 
- **Implications for settlement:** Human colonization possible but requires adaptation: medical mitigation for high gravity, structural reinforcement, climate control. 
- **Distinction:** 
 - All Argeics are Geotics, but skew toward higher mass/density. 
 - Only a small subset are Gaean. 
 - Serves as the WCB counterpart to **“superhabitable” exoplanets** in the scientific literature. 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **Argeic** — Parahabitable terrestrial super-Earth, biosphere-rich but human-straining. 
- **m, ρ, g, r, vₑ** — Fundamental planemon parameters (Earth-relative). 
- **Superhabitable Zone** — WCB framing of biosphere-enhancing corridors. 
- **Overlap Fraction:** ≈13.9% of Argeics are also Gaean. 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- Consolidates external “superhabitable” terminology under the WCB neolex **Argeic**. 
- Provides numeric corridors to distinguish Argeics from Geotics and Gaeans. 
- Complements **Justifying Parahabitable Parameter Limits** by filling in the higher-mass end of the spectrum. 

## Abstract 4
**Major Topics:** 
- Defines **Telluric planemons** as solid- or semi-solid-surfaced worlds across a wide mass range, regardless of habitability. 
- Parameter ranges (relative to Earth units ⨁): 
 - **Mass (m):** ⟨0.01 ∧ 10.00⟩ 
 - **Density (ρ):** ⟨0.50 ∧ 7.00⟩ 
 - **Surface gravity (g):** ⟨0.15 ∧ 8.00⟩ 
 - **Radius (r):** ⟨0.15 ∧ 3.00⟩ 
 - **Escape velocity (vₑ):** ⟨0.20 ∧ 3.00⟩ 
- Encompasses rocky, metallic, and icy planemons: Earthlike planets, super-Earths, sub-Earths, Mars, Titan, Ganymede, Io, Kepler-20b, etc. 
- **Core role in canon:** 
 - All **Geotic**, **Gaean**, and **Argeic** planemons are subsets of Tellurics. 
 - ~4.8% of Tellurics are Geotics; ~0.55% are Gaeans; ~3.6% are Argeics. 
- Many Tellurics are **parahabitable**: survivable only with life support, domes, or partial terraforming. 
- Symbolic note: term derives from *Tellus* (Earth-mother), but used **structurally, not biologically**. 

**Relations to Other Types:** 
- Overlaps with **Xenotic** planemons in rocky mass range. 
- Differentiation: **Telluric = structural (rocky/icy/metallic)** vs. **Xenotic = exotic composition**. 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **Telluric [NEW].** 
- **Geotic [neo], Gaean [neo], Argeic [neo], Xenotic [neo], Parahabitable [neo]** (already canonical, here reinforced). 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- Introduces **Telluric** as a new umbrella category. 
- Integrates existing WCB planemon types (Geotic, Gaean, Argeic, Xenotic, Parahabitable) under this umbrella. 
- **Status:** [NEW + EXPANDED] — Telluric is newly defined; expands canon by clarifying relationships among existing planemon classes. 

## Abstract 5
**Major Topics:** 
- Defines **Xenotic planemons** as worlds whose potential biospheres are **non-Earthlike**, supporting alien chemistries or life systems (non-carbonic, non-water-based, etc.). 
- Parameter envelope (relative to Earth units ⨁): 
 - Mass: ⟨0.0001 ∧ 4131⟩ 
 - Density: ⟨0.01 ∧ 7.00⟩ 
 - Gravity: ⟨0.02 ∧ 60.00⟩ 
 - Radius: ⟨0.02 ∧ 11.00⟩ 
 - Escape velocity: ⟨0.02 ∧ 25.00⟩ 
- Emphasis: Xenotic classification is **not structural** (unlike Telluric, Geotic, etc.), but **biological**, about what kinds of life might emerge. 
- Inclusions: ammonia/methane-based biospheres, silicon-based or plasma-phase life, deep high-pressure gas giant biota, crystalline metabolic substrates, etc. 
- Exclusions: simply being Geotic or Gaean does not make a world Xenotic. A planet may fall within Gaean/Geotic physical parameters and still be Xenotic if its biosphere is alien. 
- Symbolic origin: from Greek *xenos* (ξένος), “stranger,” “outsider.” 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **Xenotic [NEW].** 
- **Gaean, Geotic, Telluric [neo]:** overlapping categories, but distinct. 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- **Xenotic** does not appear in earlier canon abstracts — this file introduces it formally. 
- Distinction is clear: **Telluric = structure**, **Gaean = Earthlike habitability**, **Xenotic = alien biosphere potential**. 
- **Status:** [NEW] — introduces Xenotic as a new category of planemons defined by biotic potential outside Earth norms. 

## Abstract 6
**Major Topics:** 
- Summarizes the external concept of **“superhabitable planemons”** (Heller & Armstrong, 2014), proposed as worlds more conducive to diverse biospheres than Earth. 
- Criteria include: 
 - **Stellar hosts:** spectral classes M0–G9, masses ⟨0.359 ∧ 0.817⨀⟩, lifetimes ≥ 3 Ga. 
 - **planemon properties:** 
 - Mass: ⟨2.0 ∧ 3.0⨁⟩ (optimum ≈ 2.0⨁). 
 - Radius: ⟨1.260 ∧ 1.442⨁⟩ (Earthlike density/gravitation). 
 - Strong tectonics, carbon–silicate cycling, thicker atmosphere, stronger magnetic shielding. 
 - Flatter surface, shallower oceans with ~71% global coverage. 
 - Mean temperature ≈ 25 °C; O₂ concentration > 20.95%. 
 - Orbits near the center of the host star’s habitable zone. 
- Scientific rationale: slightly more massive than Earth → longer tectonic/geological cycling, better climate stabilization, stronger magnetic protection, smoother surface conditions. 
- Supported by Noack & Breuer (2011) on tectonic propensity in 1–5 M⊕ range. 

**Relation to WCB Canon:** 
- WCB does **not** use the term “superhabitable.” 
- Instead, these criteria are encompassed within **Argeic planemons**, which refine the same concept for WCB internal classifications. 
- External term is acknowledged for context but not adopted into lexicon. 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **Superhabitable [exo]:** external concept (Heller & Armstrong, 2014). 
- **Argeic planemons [neo]:** WCB equivalent classification. 
- **Carbon–Silicate Cycle [sci].** 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- Argeic planemons are already part of WCB classification. 
- “Superhabitable” remains external-only, acknowledged but not canonized. 
- **Status:** [EXPANDED + EXO] — expands habitability framework with external criteria; adopts internal Argeic equivalent. 

## Abstract 7
**Major Topics:** 
- Defines **micromon** as a distinct category of **Small Stellar System Bodies (SSSBs)**, separate from planemons (planetary-mass objects) and stellamons (stellar-mass objects). 
- Establishes a **compositional/conformational taxonomy** with three main classes: 
 - **Telluroids**: rocky/metallic micromons (e.g., S-type, C-type, Vestoids, M-type). 
 - **Astatoids**: volatile-rich micromons, subdivided into: 
 - Pagooid (icy) 
 - Fluxoid (liquid-dominated, hypothetical) 
 - Ceroid (ice + subsurface ocean) 
 - **Ulsoids**: exotic or cryptic micromons, subdivided into: 
 - Exotoid (exotic matter) 
 - Cryptoid (mysterious/unclassified, e.g. ‘Oumuamua). 
- Establishes **upper bounds** for micromon classification: ≤ 250 µT (0.00025 T) or ≤ 600 km radius. 
- Distinguishes **meteoroids** as a size-only category (<1 m), separate from micromon conformations. 
- Draws parallels with familiar Solar System bodies (asteroids, comets, icy moons) while introducing new subtypes for speculative/exotic cases. 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **micromon**: umbrella category for small stellar system bodies. 
- **Telluroid, Astatoid, Ulsoid**: principal micromon conformations. 
- **Pagooid, Fluxoid, Ceroid, Exotoid, Cryptoid**: subtype classifications. 
- **µT (Teras Mass Unit)**: threshold measure for micromon mass (≤ 250 µT). 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- Glossary entries for micromon and Telluroid were **newly added in v1.222**. 
- Glossary entries for Astatoid, Ceroid, Fluxoid, Ulsoid, Exotoid, Cryptoid were **updated in v1.222** to replace placeholder structural definitions with these refined compositional/conformational definitions. 
- Reinforces WCB’s hierarchical taxonomy: **stellamon → planemon → micromon → Conformations**. 
- Aligns terminology with the broader WCB classification framework and avoids conflict with deprecated placeholder definitions.
