# Module 01 — Designing Your Habitable Planet

## 🎯 Module Goal

Build a scientifically-plausible, Earthlike world suitable for human-like life: breathable atmosphere, reasonable gravity, stable climate.

## 🗺 Context

"If you want your characters to walk around in shirtsleeves, start here.  
If you want them to need pressure suits... keep reading."

## 🔧 Key Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mass | Drives gravity and atmosphere retention |
| Radius | Surface area and gravity calculations |
| Density | Composition approximation |
| Surface Gravity | Key for biology & physiology |
| Escape Velocity | Atmosphere loss modeling |
| Surface Temperature | Climate baseline |

## 📝 Formula Walkthrough

Each formula introduced here will be fully explained, with all variables defined before use.

### Surface Gravity

g = GM / R²

Where:  
- g = surface gravity (m/s²)  
- M = planetary mass (kg)  
- R = planetary radius (m)  
- G = universal gravitational constant

## 🔢 Worked Example

Provide full worked calculation with real numbers.
