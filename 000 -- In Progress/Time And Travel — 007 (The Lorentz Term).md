The Lorentz term is a factor of how much the local passage of time, length (in the direction of motion), and relativistic mass change when an object is in motion.
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}
$$
Where:
- $\beta$ = the velocity expressed as a percentage of the speed of light $^v/_c$.

All motion results in some magnitude of the Lorentz term (GPS satellites have to take it into account to return accurate results).  As velocity increases, the Lorentz term increases exponentially.

This equation was developed by the Dutch Physicist Hendrik Lorentz in the late $19^{th}$ century as part of a broader set of equations called the Lorentz transformations.  He developed these as part of his effort to determine whether or not a cosmic space-filling substance (_luminous æther_) existed.  (It doesn't).

When it became clear that all electromagnetic phenomena, including visible light, has wavelike properties, it was believed that all waves needed a physical medium through which to propagate.  It was reasoned, then, that there must be a substance filling "empty" space in which light waves moved.  Yet all attempts to detect or measure the qualities of this æther failed.

An early explanation of the failure of these experiments was that linear distances might be compressed in the direction of motion due to pressure from the æther building up against the forward faces of the object.  If this were true, then light waves and any measuring device would also be compressed along the same vector and so a measurment would always return the same value because all elements of the system were being altered by the same ratio.

Lorentz developed his equations to calculate the amount of compression that motion through the æther would cause. When Michelson and Morley’s experiments showed that the æther did not exist — and did not need to — the math itself did not vanish. Lorentz had the equations right, but the _context_ wrong. A generation later, Einstein reinterpreted them: not as distortions caused by a cosmic medium, but as the natural geometry of spacetime itself.

Einstein's recontextualizing of the Lorentz transformations shows that, as the velocity of an object such as a space ship approaches the speed of light, the ship's linear dimension in the direction of motion contracts — so that much of the theory **was** true, there just wasn't any substance physically causing the contraction.

Einstein also realized that for the object in motion, time passes more slowly by the same Lorentz factor (though to an observer on or in the moving object, no change in the "flow" of time is apparent).  And, finally, the kinetic mass of the ship (as measured by an outside observer), also increases by the same factor of the Lorentz term.  Thus, the speed of light, the passage of time, and mass are all constant for every observer.  A passenger onboard a ship with a velocity of 0.99c would measure a rod as a meter long, while to an outside observer, the rod would appear shorter by the factor:
$$
\frac{1}{\gamma} = \sqrt{1 - 0.99^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.98} = \sqrt{0.0199} = 0.1411
$$
To the outside observer, the rod would appear to be only about $14.1$ cm in length.

> Note: this shows that while length _contracts_, time _expands_ and mass _increases_.  To calculate
> - Length contraction: multiply by $\frac{1}{\gamma}$
> - Time dilation (expansion): multiply by $\gamma$.
> - Mass increase: multiply by $\gamma$.

For example: to those inside the ship, one minute would be sixty seconds long.  To those looking in from outside, a minute on the ship would last:
$$
\begin{align}
\gamma &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.99^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.98}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0199}} = \frac{1}{0.1411} = 7.089 \\[0.5em]
T_\gamma &= 60 \times 7.089 ≈ 425\;\text{seconds}
\end{align}
$$
… just over 425 seconds — or 7.089 minutes (7ᵐ 5.33ˢ).

A $50$-kilogram person stepping on a scale onboard ship would see the scale report their weight as $50$ kilograms, but if an exterior observer were able to measure the person's mass, they would see them weighing almost $355$ kilograms.  Also, if the person onboard the ship made a round trip of $50$ years according to their clock, they would return to find that almost $355$ years had passed on Earth!

> This is the source of the so-called "Twin Paradox": if one twin makes a round-trip journey at $0.99$c of $10$ years by their own clock, they will return to find that about $71$ years have passed on Earth. If both twins were both $20$ years old at departure, the traveler will return at age $30$ — to a sibling who has aged through all of those $71$ years and is now $91$ years old, making the stay-at-home twin **$\mathbf{61}$ years older** than their traveling sibling.

This shows that at rest (in one's own reference frame) the Lorentz term is 1.0, but as soon as _any_ motion is applied, a Lorentz term comes into effect — small at first but growing rapidly as the velocity approaches the speed of light.  At 0.9999c, the Lorentz term is:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9999^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9998}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0000199}} = \frac{1}{0.01411} = 70.7
$$

This is the source of the common expression "nothing can travel faster than light"; at the speed of light it would require an infinite amount of energy to increase velocity by the minuscule amount needed to "break the light barrier".
## The Dramatic Side of Relativity
One of the "features" of relativity is that there is no "correct" frame of reference.  We've noted above that the crew of a ship traversing at 0.99c still measures a minute as 60 seconds, whereas to "back home" that "minute" lasts 7 minutes and 5.33 seconds.

At velocities even closer to the speed of light, the dilation becomes even more pronounced.  You might only experience 10 biological years aboard ship (assuming you don't spend most of the trip in cryostasis), but the "wider universe" may experience tens of thousands of chronological years.  It might happen that "back home" invents a warp drive 10 years into your journey and you arrive at your destination to find that it was colonized and tamed 9500 years ago and nobody actually remembers who you are.

The concept of "age" would necessarily take on new meaning.  Let's revisit the 0.99c scenario and make you the traveling twin.

Assuming cryostasis slows your aging down to 1 year out of every 10 years of ship-time, you'll have only biologically aged a year on your journey, so your "bioage" (let's keep the word "age" to refer to this) is only 21.  Your "proper age" is 11 years more than that (let's call that your "scope"); and the chronological duration since you were born is 71 years (we'll call that your "span")... So you are 21 years of age; 30 years "scoped", and 91 years "spanned".

A $1 you left in a high-yield savings account before your departure may have appreciated into billions — or your culture may have completely changed its material wealth concept and you have no wealth at all under the new system.  Perhaps you carried a million dollars worth of diamonds with you on your journey, but "back home" found and began mining a diamond planet 7 years after you left and now that compressed carbon in your pocket is literally more common than dirt.... 

The world*building* opportunities are endless, and endlessly fascinating.
