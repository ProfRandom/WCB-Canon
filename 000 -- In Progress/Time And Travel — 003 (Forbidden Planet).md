# Forbidden Planet
Perhaps ironically, one of the most accurate-seeming depictions of an FTL drive comes from one of the earliest: _Forbidden Planet_ (1956).  The ship, United Planets _C57D_, was said to use a "hyper-drive".  I cannot find any specific numbers for its top velocity, but some clues in the narrative and dialogue are available.  The opening voice-over says that the ship was "… more than a year out from Earth base." on a mission to Altair IV, the fourth planet of the star, Altair (α Aquilae).  Later, Commander Adams exasperatedly explains to Altaira Morbius that she needs to wear less revealing outfits because is crew has been "… locked up in hyperspace for 378 days," which is 1.035 years.

The modern distance to Altair from Earth is measured at 16.73 light-years.  From this, we can calculate that the _C57D_ traveled:
$$
v = \frac{D}{T} = \frac{16.73}{1.035} ≈ 16.164\;\text{ligh-years per year} 
$$
It seems reasonable to suppose that the _intended_ velocity was meant to be a nice, round $16$ lightyears per year, which would indicate that the writers used:
$$
D = v \times T = 16 \times 1.035 = 16.56\;\text{light-years}
$$
as the distance to Altair.  A velocity of $16$ light-years per year equates to a ST:TOS warp factor of:
$$
f = \sqrt[3]{v} = \sqrt[3]{16} = 2.52
$$
This seems like an unusually rigorous early attempt to quantify FTL, unlike later franchises that often hand-waved the numbers. More likely, though, it was a lucky coincidence: the narrative hook of a long, lonely voyage (378 days) paired with the choice of Altair — a star whose name conveniently provided an exotic but pronounceable basis for the female lead, Altaira. Had Irving Block and Allen Adler (story) or Cyril Hume (screenplay) been consciously designing a hyperdrive system, it would make more sense for them to have chosen a clean round figure like 15 light-years per year or 20 light-years per year, in the same vein as *The Orville*’s “ten light-years per hour.”

This is not to dismiss the breadth and creativity of the writers’ efforts. Rather, it highlights how “the math” of a milieu can often be back-calculated from clues in dialogue or values glimpsed on a display, even when the creators themselves were (rightly) more focused on metaphor than mathematics.
