## 📎 Sidebar: Asteroid (S3B) Types  

Asteroids — or, more broadly, **Small Star System Bodies (S3Bs)** — are not all alike.  
Their compositions reflect **where in the protoplanetary disk** they formed, and they tend to cluster into **compositional families** within belts and resonance niches.  
### 🔹 Main Classes (by composition)  

- **C-type (Carbonaceous)**  
  *Dark, primitive, volatile-rich.*  
  - Very common in outer belts.  
  - High water/ice content.  
  - Analogues: many outer-belt asteroids, comet precursors.  

- **S-type (Silicaceous)**  
  *Rocky, stony, silicate-rich.*  
  - Common in inner belts.  
  - Often parent bodies of ordinary chondrite meteorites.  
  - Analogues: much of the inner main belt.  

- **M-type (Metallic)**  
  *Iron–nickel cores of disrupted proto-planets.*  
  - Often mid-belt objects.  
  - Dense, high radar reflectivity.  
  - Analogues: 16 Psyche and smaller metallic fragments.  
### 🔹 Other Notable Types  

- **D-type / P-type**  
  *Reddish, organic-rich, volatile-rich.*  
  - Very dark, low density.  
  - Found in outer belt, Trojans, and beyond.  

- **K-type / Q-type**  
  *Intermediate spectra.*  
  - Less common.  
  - Transitional between S and C types.  

- **V-type (Vestoids)**  
  *Basaltic surface fragments.*  
  - Pieces of differentiated crust.  
  - Example: fragments of 4 Vesta.  
### 🔹 Worldbuilder shorthand  

- **Inner belts (hotter):** S-types (rocky).  
- **Middle belts (mixed):** M-types (metallic).  
- **Outer belts (colder):** C-types (carbonaceous/icy).  
- **Beyond snow line:** D/P-types (icy/organic, comet-like).  
### 📖 Worldbuilder takeaway  
When you divide a belt with resonances, don’t just think “empty lanes.”  
Each sub-belt can be **compositionally distinct**: rocky inside, metallic mid-belt, icy/carbonaceous outside.  
This makes your belts feel *alive* with variety, and gives explorers something to discover besides “more rocks.”
