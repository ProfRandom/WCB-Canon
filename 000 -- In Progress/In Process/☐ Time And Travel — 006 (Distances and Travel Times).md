The worldmaker will be confronted with a decision in designing interstellar polities. You either:
1. Invent your space-traversing technology, determine its limitations, and design the volumetric span of your civilization based on the longest necessary travel-time; or,
2. Create your milieu, including the size of your civilization's sphere of influence, and then design a drive that lets your characters get around that volume of space in reasonable amounts of time.

## Example: The Kaltai Entente
Let's specify a moderately sized elliptical galaxy (Shuf) of $10$ billion stars, spanning $350000$ light-years.  The Kaltai Entente is a federated polity of cooperative star systems that extends $1500$ light-years in radius out from the central star (Kaltai).  Thus, the Entente commands a spherical volume of about $14$ billion cubic light-years, encompassing $56.5$ _million_ star systems of which about $13$ _million_ are habitable/hospitable systems around F-, G-, and K-type stars.  That's a lot of space (and stars, and planets) to watch over.

Let's further say that the military-supported trade syndicate (KaltaiSys) has a monopoly on the modes of FTL space travel, and that there are no space-folding drive, or jump drives, or wormhole, etc.  All travel is inherently time-consumptive, distance-over-rate.  Their fastest battle cruisers can make the trip between Kaltai and their most distant colony at Taibano Raimos, 1500 light-years away, in 10 days.

Thus, these ships are capable of:
$$
\begin{align}
r &= \frac{1500\;\text{light years}}{10\;\text{days}} = 150\;\text{ly/day} \\[0.5em]
v &= 150\;\text{ly/day} \times 365.25\;\text{days/yr} = 54787.5\;\text{light-years/yr} \\[0.5em]
&= 54787.5c
\end{align}
$$
This equates to:
- _ST:TOS_ warp $37.9$
- About $12.5$% faster that a Wraith hive ship in _Stargate: Atlantis_; and
- $62.5$% of the top speed of the _Orville_

If your game, story, or show can tolerate a **10-day lag** between core and frontier, then this drive system fits your setting. But if you need supplies, reinforcements, or diplomacy to move faster than that — and you don’t want to shrink your sphere of influence — you have only two real options: 
- **Reconfigure your FTL.** Make the drive faster, reduce recharge, or relax the limits you’ve set.  
- **Invent another traversal process.** Wormholes, jump drives, fold engines, or some other mechanism that bypasses the distance–rate bottleneck altogether.
