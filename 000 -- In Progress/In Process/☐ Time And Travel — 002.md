# Other Kinds of Drive Systems
Other franchises have, in fact, made use of far speedier craft.  _The Orville_ frequently uses the term "quantum drive" to describe their FTL drive; _Star Wars_ talks about "hyperdrives"; The _FreeSpace_ game series uses "subspace drive"; the (sadly short-lived) _Dark Matter_ regularly referred to the _Raza_'s "FTL Drive", until they acquired theit "blink drive" (more on this below).

Not all of these go so far as to give actual formulas for calculating drive speeds; _The Orville_ is an exception: captain Ed Mercer mentions in the first season episode "Pria", "We have a ... quantum drive system capable of speeds exceeding 10 light years per hour," which equates to a ST:TOS warp factor of about 44.422.  At that speed, a cross-Federation ship would take the _Orville_ 33.33 days, again something akin to a steamship trip across the Atlantic Ocean.

Let’s see how other universes’ drives stack up when normalized to *Trek*’s warp scale.

These were gathered from a plethora of sources around the internet.  I'm certain there will be disagreements about them; I've only included them for illustration purposes, not to reflect any kind of "canon".

To convert a ship's speed in multiples of the speed of light to a _Star Trek_ warp factor:
$$
f_{TOS} = \sqrt[3]{v} \qquad f_{TNG} = \sqrt[\frac{10}{3}]{v}
$$
For example the _Orville_, taking 10 light years per hour as the standard, would have a "c-speed" of:
$$
\begin{align}
&\frac{10 \text{ly}}{hour} \times 8766\;\text{hours per year} = 
\end{align}
$$
So it's equivalent warp factors would be:
$$
\begin{align}
f_{TOS} &= \sqrt[3]{87660} = \mathbf{44.42} \\
f_{TNG} &= \sqrt[\frac{10}{3}]{87660} = \mathbf{30.4}
\end{align}
$$
## The Devil's In The Details
There were (frequent) inconsistencies in _ST:TOS_.  For instance, in the episode "By Any Other Name" (2/23/1968), the Kelvan commander, Rojan, states that the _Enterprise_ engines would be modified to allow travel to the Andromeda Galaxy in 300 Earth-years, and that the ship's cruising speed would thus be warp 11.

However, Andromeda is 2.5 million lightyears away.  Making the journey in 300 years would mean a velocity of:
$$
v = \frac{2500000}{300} = 8333.33\tfrac{ly}{y}
$$
… which equates to a TOS warp factor of:
$$
f_{TOS} = \sqrt[3]{8333.33} = \mathbf{20.274}
$$
… which is 184.3% of warp 11.

The *actual velocity* at warp 11 is:
$$
v = 11^3 = 1331c
$$
… which would mean the trip would take:
$$
v = \frac{2500000}{1331} = \mathbf{1878.287}\;\textbf{years}
$$
This is a prime teaching example for WCB: either a) the writers did not have an accurate distance value for Andromeda; b) they did their math wrong; c) they didn't bother with the math and wrote dialogue that sounded cool.
