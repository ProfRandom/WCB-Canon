Warp drives, hyperdrives, subspace drives, quantum drives, etc., all share the common basic notion of *actual, physical travel* through spacetime (or some subrealm thereof).  Even the Alcubierre metric assumes forward "motion" within a "bubble" of "normal" spacetime.

Other creators have opted for different solutions to the time-distance dilemma.

## Space Folding and Jump Drives
### Space Folding
Perhaps the best-known example of “space-folding” comes from Frank Herbert’s _Dune_ universe. Spacing Guild Navigators, their mental faculties expanded by the spice _melange_, cause two distant points in space to momentarily overlap, like bending a sheet of paper so that a point 1" from each opposing margin are brought into contact.  At that moment, a ship could physically relocate from origin to destination without traversing the intervening void (which, for that moment, would not actually exist). When space “unfolds,” the ship is simply _there_. For all practical purposes, the voyage is instantaneous — it takes longer to ride the shuttle up to orbit at origin and back down at destination than it does to cross between worlds.

This, of course, is entirely speculative (or outright fantastical), and even if realizable, would demand at least **Kardashev Type IV** technologies — the ability to manipulate energy on galactic scales. Yet from a world*building* perspective, _instant travel_ shifts the storytelling focus: the challenge is no longer the journey, but who controls the technology/mechanology of travel and transportation.
### Jump Drives
Jump drives accomplish much the same function as space-folding, but by **mechanotechnological (mechtech)** means rather than mystical or mental ones. The “FTL jumps” of _Battlestar Galactica_ (both versions) are a classic example, as is the “blink drive” in _Dark Matter_.

Depending on the needs of the setting, a jump drive may require measurable amounts of time and energy, or it may be treated as effectively instantaneous — “supertech” that simply relocates a ship. Likewise, jumps may be chained one after another, or require a recharge interval before firing again.

From a world*building* standpoint, these choices are critical: do you want drama from fuel shortages, from cooldown tension, from misjumps into the void — or from the sheer ease of hopping anywhere instantly? The math is malleable, but the **drama comes from the limits you set.**

This is why such mechtech is often preferred by more speculative writers: you don’t have to wrestle with the intractable realities of hard science. Instead, the _means_ recedes into the background, letting the drama occupy the foreground — focusing on the characters and their story.
### Practicum
With space-folding and jumpdrives, etc., instead of determining a maximum velocity in terms of lightspeed, one might specify a maximum traversable distance per jump, limited by available drive power, fuel consumption, or whatever other constraint one may choose to impose.

For instance, let's posit an interstellar civilization, the Serelem Union which has developed a "vault drive" with the parameters:
- Individual vaults can span any distance between 1 and 100 light-years
- The more extensive the vault, the more energy required
- The more extensive the vault, the longer the drive takes to recharge, such that
	- The vault-to-charge ratio is 1 minute of recharge per light-year of the most recent previous vault.

Now let posit the Serelemene flagship, _Tonqua_, is on a defense/rescue mission to their most distant outpost on a planet called Rylboru, $4835$ lightyears from the homeworld.  How long does it take _Tonqua_ to get there (we'll be using Earth-normal time units here for convenience)?

The number of vaults required depends on the chosen vault magnitude.  At one light-year per vault, it is $4835$ vaults; at 100 light-years per vault it is $48.35$ vaults (or, more likely $48$ vaults of $100$ light-years and a final vault of $35$ light-years.).  Let's say Captain Talua decides to make $100$ light-year vaults.  That means that after each vault, the _Tonqua_ will have to spend 100 minutes recharging its drive before it can vault again.
$$
\begin{align}
T &= 48\;\text{vaults} \times 100\;\text{minutes} = 4800\;\text{minutes} \\[0.5em]
&= \frac{4800\;\text{minutes}}{60\;\text{minutes/hour}} = 80\;\text{hours} \\[0.5em]
&= \frac{80\;\text{hours}}{24\;\text{hr/day}} = 3.\overline{3}\;\text{days} \\[0.5em]
&≈ 3\;\text{days, } 8\;\text{hours}
\end{align}
$$
(We don't need to account for the recharge time after the last $35$ light-year vault, because it will transpire at the destination.)

This equates to an apparent velocity of:
$$
\begin{align}
v &= \frac{D}{T} = \frac{4800}{3.\overline{3}} = 1440\;\text{light-years per day} \\[0.5em]
&\text{Remember that the last vault adds recharge time, but not travel time!} \\[0.5em]
&= 1440\;\text{ly/day} \times 365.25\;\text{days} \\[0.5em]
&= 525960\;\text{light-years per year} \\[0.5em]
&= 525960c \\[1.5em]
f_{TOS} &= \sqrt[\frac{10}{3}]{525960} = 80.721
\end{align}
$$
To put it another way, a _ST:TOS_ ship at warp $8$ would need $9.44$ days to cover the same distance.

> Note that the travel time is the same regardless of how the vaults are chosen, arranged.
> - $1000$ vaults of 1 minute recharge each is still a total of $4800$ minutes of recharge
> - $100$ vaults of $24$ light-years means $2400$ minutes of recharge; completing the trip with $2400$ vaults of 1 light-year is another $2400$ minutes of recharge, for, again, a total of $4800$ minutes of recharge.

Looking back at our ship speed listing from earlier this makes _Tonqua_
- About $\frac{1}{17}$ times as fast as the _Millennium Falcon_
- Approximately $\frac{3}{4}$ as fast as the _GunStar_
- Around $1.44$ times faster than the _Moya_
- _Exactly_ $6$ times faster than the  _Orville_
- More-or-less $548.45$ times faster than the _PIllar of Autumn_
- *Precisely* $2435$ times faster than *ST:TOS* warp 6
### Wormholes and Stargates

Travel by wormhole, as in _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ or _Stargate_, achieves the same end as space-folding or jump drives, but by exploiting a hypothesized natural phenomenon: conduits in spacetime that connect two distant points through a substrate (or superstrate) of “normal” space.

Naturally occurring wormholes may have permanently fixed endpoints: you enter one end of the Chunnel and you always exit the other. Or they may be unstable: opening and closing at unpredictable intervals; fixed at one end but wandering at the other; or even distorting time so that traversal involves dilation — or outright _time travel_.

> Imagine a milieu in which an advanced civilization builds a galaxy-spanning civilization by means of a wormhole, unaware that one end of the conduit is temporally displaced by millennia. If physical travel between the two termini is impossible, would the discrepancy in eras even _matter_?

Another dramatic limitation, as in _Stargate_, is when wormholes are generated by **mechtech** devices. In that case, both origin and destination must host a physical machine — which can itself be relocated, creating the possibility of shifting or contesting endpoints.

As always, one may specify instantaneous or finite-time traversal, and decide how such wormholes are powered. The physics can be left hand-wavy — what matters for world_building_ is how these limits shape drama, conflict, and control.
