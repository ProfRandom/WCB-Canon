# 🌍 Planemon Framework (Master Map)

All **planemons** (planetary monons) share a **common trunk** — then branch into two complementary classification systems.

## 🪨 Conformation Branch (Structural / Physical)


| Order  | Forms                |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| Lithic | Petriform, Carboform |
|Rheic|Pagoform, Fluxiform|
|Aeric|Transiform, Pneumoform, Haliform|
|Ulsic|Neutraform, Quarkform, Exoticform, etc.|

## 🌱 Animotic Branch (Life-Relevance / Biospheric)
Focus: **How the planemon relates to life (esp. Earthlike envelopes)**
- **Class** → Broad livability envelopes
    - Geotic (Earth-normal range)
    - Gaean (Earth-twin slice of Geotic)
    - Argeic (super-Earths with biospheric richness)
    - Xenotic (exotic chemistries / non-carbonic)
- **Type** → Subdivisions of classes
    - Marginal Geotic, Dense Hot Argeic, etc.

- **Somatics** → Global physical conditions
    - Cryostate (frozen) 
    - Hydrostate (temperate hydrosphere)
    - Pyrostate (runaway greenhouse)
    - Pluristate (diverse climates)
    - etc.

- **Climatics** → Finer descriptors of atmospheric/seasonal character 
    - Tempestal (storm-dominated)
    - Zephyral (mild winds, gentle climate)
    - Serenal (stable, calm, serene environment)

## 🧭 Principle
- **Conformation** = *physical chemistry* of the body.
- **Animotics** = *life-relevance* of the body.
- Both are **valid, independent lenses** for describing the same planemon.
- Example:
    - Earth = Lithic (Order) → Petriform (Form)
    - Earth = Geotic (Class) → Gaean (Type) → Pluristate (State) → Serenal (Condition)##
