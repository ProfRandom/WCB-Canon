## Abstract 
**Major Topics:** 
- Extends the WCB stellar framework into **full system design**, showing how to derive plausible orbital structures around any star classified in *Stars 1–3.* 
- Establishes **empirical orbital intervals** drawn from Solar-System and exoplanet data, defining three statistical regimes for spacing adjacent planemon orbits: 
 - **Conservative:** ⟨1.4 ∧ 2.0⟩ AU 
 - **Medial:** ⟨1.2 ∧ 3.5⟩ AU 
 - **Optimistic:** ⟨1.0 ∧ 5.0⟩ AU 
- Defines formal methods for generating additional orbits relative to a known **basal orbit** (usually the nucleal N or perannual P orbit): 
 - **Intrabasal process:** successive inward division. 
 - **Extrabasal process:** successive outward multiplication. 
 - Both constrained by user-chosen minimum and maximum orbit limits (Ω). 
- Provides pseudocode-style formulae for iteratively constructing **complete orbital ladders** from any anchor orbit, ensuring intervals remain statistically realistic. 
- Demonstrates the method through a **worked Solar-type example**, producing an eleven-orbit system consistent with WCB habitability and spacing criteria. 
- Integrates thermozone boundaries (H₀–H₅) and animozones to classify each orbit’s environmental potential within the generated system. 
- Derives stellar and orbital parameters for the example star (N = 0.834 AU, L = 0.696 ⊙, T = 0.953 ⊙, Spectral Type G4.7) and analyzes its planemon spacing. 
- Highlights the interplay between **nucleal** and **perannual** orbits: shows that both cannot host planemons simultaneously when their interval I < 1.5 AU, emphasizing the design trade-offs between orbital flux and orbital period. 
- Provides quantitative and symbolic tools for deciding when to retain, remove, or shift worlds to maintain physical and narrative plausibility in a star system. 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **N (Nucleal Orbit):** irradiance-equivalent orbit. 
- **P (Perannual Orbit):** period-equivalent orbit. 
- **H₀–H₅ (Thermozones):** standardized thermal corridors. 
- **Ω:** limiting inner or outer system boundary. 
- **I:** orbital interval ratio between adjacent orbits. 
- **Intrabasal / Extrabasal:** inward vs. outward orbit-generation processes. 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- Builds on *Stars 1 — Fundamental Orbits* (definitions of N and P) and *Stars 3 — Solar Analogs and Habitability* (OHI and thermozonal structure). 
- Forms the **link between stellar physics and planetary distribution**, preparing for later modules on **resonance, binaries, and system evolution.** 
- Requires no new glossary entries; applies previously defined symbols in procedural form.
