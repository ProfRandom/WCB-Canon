## Equations of State
A regularized set of empirical relationships can be used to estimate any stellar parameter from the others — assuming a Main Sequence **blackbody**-like star (see [[Sidebar — What Is The Main Sequence]]).

> **Keppy**: And a **blackbod**y is...?

Excellent question!  A **blackbody** is an **idealized physical object** that:
1. **Absorbs all** incoming electromagnetic radiation — no reflection, no transmission.
2. **Emits radiation** purely based on its temperature — not its material, shape, or color.
3. Emits a **perfectly smooth, continuous spectrum** (a "thermal spectrum").

In short:
> A blackbody is the theoretical gold standard for radiant heat emission — a perfect radiator and absorber.

#### Why "Blackbody" Matters Here
Most stars (especially Main Sequence stars) behave **approximately like blackbodies**, meaning their energy output can be modeled using **temperature alone**. This makes them excellent candidates for:
- **Temperature-based modeling**
- **Color-temperature mapping** (blue = hotter, red = cooler)
- **Spectrum-based classification** (like spectral classes O–M)
- Real-World Deviation
	- planemons, dust clouds, and even stars aren’t *perfect* blackbodies.
	- Real objects have an **emissivity** ϵ between 0 and 1:

$$ F = \varepsilon \sigma T^4$$
- But stars are close enough that the **blackbody approximation works very well**.

> **Hippy**: Sorry you asked, Keplarius?

Yes, that's a bit technical and complicated, but it's also extremely *important* to what comes next.

Here are the promised equations:

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
\text{Temperature} &\text{Mass} &\text{Radius} &\text{Lifetime} \\[0.1em]
\text{(T)} &\text{(M)} &\text{(R)} & \text{($Q$)} \\[0.5em] 
\hline\\[-2pt]
T=\sqrt[1.98]{M} & M=\sqrt[0.9]{R} & R=M^{0.9} & Q=M^{-2.5} \\[0.5em]
T=\sqrt[1.8]{R} & M=T^{1.98} & R=T^{1.8} & Q \approx \sqrt[-0.36]{R} \\[0.5em]
T=Q^{-0.2} & M=Q^{-0.4} & R=Q^{-0.36} & Q=T^{-5}
\end{array}
$$
> > **NOTE**:
> > All of the above equations are *approximations*; stars are a much more variable set of objects (after all, they're mostly gas and plasma, so fluid dynamics plays a major role in their characteristics).  These equations work **best *in general* for main sequence stars** of all classes.

> **Keppy**: You said Luminosity was the second most important parameter for stars, but it doesn't appear in the table...?

Well spotted, Keppy!  There's a reason.
### The Stefan-Boltzmann Law
The Stefan-Boltzmann Law is a formulation that relates the **luminosity** of any luminous object to its **temperature** and **surface area**:

$$
L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
$$
Where:
- $4 \pi R^2$  = the surface area of the body
- $T$ = is the temperature of the body in Kelvin
- $σ$ = the Stefan-Boltzmann constant
	- $\sigma = 5.670374419 \times 10^{-8} W m^{-2}K^{-4}$
		- **Watts** per square meter per Kelvin to the fourth power 1 K⁴
		- It tells you how much **radiant energy per second** (i.e., power) is emitted by a **1 square meter** portion of a **perfect blackbody** at **1 K⁴**.

And this is why we needed the quick aside into the term "blackbody" earlier.

In worldmaking terms, we can simplify the Stefan-Boltzmann equation to:

$$
\dfrac{L_s}{L_{Sun}} = \left(\dfrac{R_s}{R_{Sun}}\right)^2 \left(\dfrac{K_s}{K_{Sun}}\right)^4
$$
Where:
- $L_S$ = the absolute luminosity of the star
- $L_{Sun}$ = the absolute luminosity of the Sun
- $R_S$ = the absolute radius of the star
- $R_{Sun}$ = the absolute radius of the Sun
- $K_S$ = the Kelvin temperature of the star
- $K_{Sun}$ = the Kelvin temperature of the Sun

Because the form $\dfrac{X_s}{X_{Sun}}$ is the standard for converting a parameter to solar units, and $T = \dfrac{K_s}{K_{Sun}}$, this equation becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
L &= R^2T^4, \qquad \text{with derivations of} \\ \\
R &= \dfrac{\sqrt{L}}{T^2}, \qquad
T = \sqrt[4]{\dfrac{L}{R^2}}
\end{aligned}
$$
## Parameter Calculation Precedence
The above being the case, there is a "best" order for calculating stellar parameters when starting from any given parameter (though it is always best start with *K* or *T* whenever possible).

> All parameters (except K) are expressed in Solar-relative units; that is, T = 1⊙ for 5800 K, R = 1⊙ for the solar radius, etc.

#### Starting with Temperature (*T*) or (*K*)
**Primary dependency chain**: T/K → R → L → M → Q

$$
\begin{aligned}
T &= \dfrac{K}{5800} \quad or \quad K = 5800T \\
R &= T^{1.8} \\
L &= R^2T^4 \\
M &= T^{1.98} \quad or \quad M = \sqrt[0.9]{R} \\
Q &= T^{-5} \quad or \quad Q = M^{-2.5}
\end{aligned}
$$
#### Starting with Mass (*M*)
**Primary dependency chain**: M → T/K → R → L → Q

$$
\begin{aligned}
T &= \sqrt[1.98]{M} \\
K &= 5800T \\
R &= T^{1.8} \quad or \quad R = M^{0.9} \\
L &= R^2T^4 \\
Q &= T^{-5} \quad or \quad Q = M^{-2.5}
\end{aligned}
$$
#### Starting with Radius (*R*)
**Primary dependency chain**: R → T → K → L → M → Q

$$
\begin{aligned}
T &= \sqrt[1.8]{R} \\
K &= 5800T \\
L &= R^2T^4 \\
M &= T^{1.98} \\
Q &= T^{-5} \quad or \quad Q = M^{-2.5}
\end{aligned}
$$
#### Starting With Luminosity (*L*)
**Primary dependency chain**: L → T → K → R → M → Q

$$
\begin{aligned}
T &= \sqrt[7.6]{L} \\
K &= 5800T \\
R &= T^{1.8} \\
M &= T^{1.98} \\
Q &= T^{-5} \quad or \quad Q = M^{-2.5}
\end{aligned}
$$
#### Starting with Lifetime (Q)
**As soon as you assume you'd never want to do this, you'll find a case for doing it.**
**Primary dependency chain**: Q → T → K → R → L → M

$$
\begin{aligned}
T &= Q^{-0.2} \\
K &= 5800 T \\
R &= Q^{-0.36} \\
L &= R^2 T^4 \\
M &= \sqrt[3]{L}
\end{aligned}
$$

> **Hippy**: "Wha–"

… *which is too complex and extensive to detail here* — suggests that *modest* adjustments to a couple of key exponents yield parameter equations that better reflect observed stellar characteristics. Since worldmaking prioritizes plausible-world construction over strict theoretical purity, these revised values offer better performance across the mass range of interest.

**Notes**:
- The parameter relationship that changed from the previous table was $T ↔︎ M$, where the exponent increased slightly from $1.98$ to $2.0$
- The **major change** is the addition of direct calculation for the parameters to-and-from luminosity; these are included for the purpose of simplifying much of the math related to [[M002 - Stars — 08 `Sun-Like` Stars ✓]].
- **For *greatest accuracy***:
	- The exponent $7.6$ can be more precisely specified as $7.5778$
	- The exponent $3.8$ can be more precisely specified as $3.7889$
