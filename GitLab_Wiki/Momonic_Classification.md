# Classification Rule — The Monon Condition

> **All WCB monoseries (planemon, intermon, stellamon, etc.) refer exclusively to individual, gravitationally coherent bodies — not to multi-body systems, collections, or regions.**

### 🔒 What *Is* a Monon

A **monon** is defined by:
- A single, well-defined **center of mass**  
- Internally unified **gravitational structure**  
- Physically continuous **volume** (or event horizon, in the case of black holes)  
- Examples: **planemons, intermons, stellamons, supermons, ultramons, hypermons**

### 🚫 What *Is Not* a Monon

| Category | Example | Reason for Exclusion |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Star Clusters** | Globular clusters, open clusters | Multi-body systems |
| **Nebulae / Clouds** | Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) | Diffuse, non-contiguous matter |
| **Galaxies** | Milky Way, Andromeda | Aggregates of many gravitational centers |
| **Binary Systems** | Sirius A+B, Pluto–Charon | Contain ≥ 2 centers of mass |
| **Black Hole Binaries** | LIGO-detected pairs | Still system-level constructs |

## **WCB Monon Rule (Monoseries Scope Clarification)**

> **All mononic classifications** (*planemon, intermon, stellamon, cryptomon, etc.*)  
> apply only to **individual, contiguous, gravitationally self-bound objects**.  
>  
> Multi-object systems — whether binary, ternary, or aggregate — are **not themselves monons**, even if composed entirely of monons.

### 🧠 Key Principles

1. **Monoseries is not emergent.**  
   A *system of planemons* is not a larger planemon.  
   A *binary of stellamons* is not a single, larger stellamon.

2. **Modeling convenience ≠ ontological unity.**  
   In orbital mechanics, it is **useful** to treat a binary as a single object of combined mass.  
   Ontotypically, however, the **barycenter abstraction** is *not* a monon.

3. **Distinct gravitational fields.**  
   - A monon has one **center of mass**, even if dynamic (e.g., a rotating planemon).  
   - A system has **multiple discrete centers**, even if mathematically reducible.  

> For instance, in a double-star stellamonic system, it may be convenient to treat the two stellamons as a single mass centered on the barycenter of their orbits.  
> Yet this is only a **mathematical convenience** derived from system properties — not a **physical entity** in itself.
