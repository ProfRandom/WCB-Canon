# 🪐 The Hierarchy of Mononic Systems

## 1 · Monons — The Singular
A **Monon** is any independent, self-coherent body: a planet, star, grain of sand, or drop of water.  
It is the fundamental *unit of being.*

| Tier | Full form | Common form | Binding principle | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Monon** | –mon | –mon | Identity | planet, star |

## 2 · Cules — Unity by Likeness
The suffix **–cule** (from *–culon*, “small body”) marks a directly bound group of *similar* monons.  
Cules are **homogeneous** systems: members of the same Mononic Class bound together.

| Example | Canonical Term | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| two planets | **duacule < duaculon** | pair of Duramons (double planet) |
| three stars | **ternacule < ternaculon** | trinary of Stellamons |
| four or more | **multicule < multiculon** | homogeneous multiple |
| spoken contractions | *quadrule*, *quinule* | vowel-prefix elision for euphony |

> **Euphonic rule:**  
> When a vowel-ending prefix precedes –cule, the *c* may be dropped (*quadrule* < *quadracule*).  
>  
> **Concept:** Cules express *unity by resemblance* — kinship and symmetry among equals.

> **Terminology note:**  
> The older term **Duomon** (two-body system) is synonymous with **Duacule**,  
> used when both members remain gravitationally bound and dynamically coupled.

## 3 · Lexes — Unity by Connection
The suffix **–lex** (from *–plexon*, related to *complex*, “to weave, intertwine”) marks a bound group of *unlike* monons or cules.  
Lexes are **heterogeneous** systems: members of differing Mononic Classes woven by shared fields.

| Example | Canonical Term | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| star + planets | **Stellalex < Stellalexon** | Stellamon primary with Duramons or Peramons |
| planet + moons | **Duralex < Duralexon** | Duramon primary with satellites |
| resonance chain | **Peralex < Peralexon** | Peramonic network (e.g., binary black holes) |
| trinary stars + planets | **Stellar Ternalex < Stellar Ternalexon** | three stars + planets |
| spoken contractions | *quinex*, *ternex* | vowel-prefix elision allowed |

> **Euphonic rule:**  
> When a vowel-ending prefix precedes –lex, the *l* may be dropped (*quinex* < *quinalex*).  
>  
> **Concept:** Lexes express *unity by relationship* — interdependence and function within diversity.

## 4 · Gates — Unity by Context
The suffix **–gate** (from *aggregate*, Latin *aggregare*, “to bring together”) denotes macro-systems composed of multiple Lexes or Cules.  
Gates and **Aggregations** are large-scale, often statistical domains.

| Example | Canonical Term | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| pair of galaxies | **Duagate < Duagation** | binary aggregate |
| triple galaxy system | **Ternate < Ternagation** | triple aggregate |
| galaxy cluster | **Multigate < Multigation** | many-membered aggregate |
| cosmic filament | **Stellagate / Peragate** | vast stellar or peramonic collective |

> **Concept:** Gates express *unity by context* — coherence arising from shared fields or large-scale topology.

## 5 · Summary Hierarchy

| Level | Full form → Common form | Binding principle | Composition | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Monon** | –mon | Identity | singular | planet, star |
| **Cule** | –culon → –cule | Likeness | homogeneous | binary or multiple of same class |
| **Lex** | –lexon → –lex | Connection | heterogeneous | star + planets, planet + moons |
| **Gate** | –gation → –gate | Context | collective field | galaxy, cluster |

## 6 · Conceptual Symmetry
- **–Cule** = *unity by sameness* (kinship)  
- **–Lex** = *unity by difference* (interaction)  
- **–Gate** = *unity by context* (collective field)  

Each suffix is **dimensionless** — it defines the *type of coherence*, not its scale.

> **Monon → Cule → Lex → Gate**  
> — from the One that endures, to the Few that cohere, to the Many that connect, to the Vast that contains.

## 🪶 Mythosophic Reflection — *The Grammar of Being*

> **Lexemic Principle — The Grammar of Being**  
> Every suffix marks a degree of ontic coherence:  
> **–mon** (*selfhood*), **–cule** (*kinship*), **–lex** (*relationship*), **–gate** (*context*).  
>  
> Together they articulate the world’s passage from the **individual** to the **infinite** —  
> the grammar by which existence conjugates itself into form.
