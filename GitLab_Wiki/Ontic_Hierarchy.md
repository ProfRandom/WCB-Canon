# 🪐 The Hierarchy of Mononic Systems

# Ontic Regimes

**Ontic Regimes** describe the dominant cohesive forces that define how matter and energy maintain unity.  
> They mark the transition from subatomic to cosmic coherence — from the nucleus that holds together to the star that endures.

| **Regime** | **Binding Force** | **Scale** | **Examples** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Nuclear Regime** | Strong and weak nuclear forces | Atomic nuclei | neutronium, fusion cores |
| **Molecular Regime** | Electromagnetic bonding | Molecular and crystalline matter | lithic, rheic, aeric bodies |
| **Gravitational Regime** | Self-gravitation | Planetary and stellar bodies | planemons, stellamons, peramons |
| **Field Regime** | Energetic or spacetime curvature fields | Relativistic or exotic matter | black holes, cryptomons, hyperstellamons |

Each regime represents a distinct **mode of coherence**, determined by the dominant physical interaction at its scale.  
Together they form the backbone of **Ontic hierarchy**, linking the smallest bound particle to the largest self-coherent body.


## 1 · Monons — The Singular
A **Monon** is any independent, self-coherent body: a planet, star, grain of sand, or drop of water.  
It is the fundamental *unit of being.*

| Tier | Full form | Common form | Binding principle | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Monon** | –mon | –mon | Identity | planet, star |

## 2 · Cules — Unity by Likeness
The suffix **–cule** (from *–culon*, “small body”) marks a directly bound group of *similar* monons.  
Cules are **homogeneous** systems: members of the same Mononic Class bound together.

| Example | Canonical Term | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| two planets | **duacule < duaculon** | pair of Duramons (double planet) |
| three stars | **ternacule < ternaculon** | trinary of Stellamons |
| four or more | **multicule < multiculon** | homogeneous multiple |
| spoken contractions | *quadrule*, *quinule* | vowel-prefix elision for euphony |

> **Euphonic rule:**  
> When a vowel-ending prefix precedes –cule, the *c* may be dropped (*quadrule* < *quadracule*).  
>  
> **Concept:** Cules express *unity by resemblance* — kinship and symmetry among equals.

> **Terminology note:**  
> The older term **Duomon** (two-body system) is synonymous with **Duacule**,  
> used when both members remain gravitationally bound and dynamically coupled.

## 3 · Lexes — Unity by Connection
The suffix **–lex** (from *–plexon*, related to *complex*, “to weave, intertwine”) marks a bound group of *unlike* monons or cules.  
Lexes are **heterogeneous** systems: members of differing Mononic Classes woven by shared fields.

| Example | Canonical Term | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| star + planets | **Stellalex < Stellalexon** | Stellamon primary with Duramons or Peramons |
| planet + moons | **Duralex < Duralexon** | Duramon primary with satellites |
| resonance chain | **Peralex < Peralexon** | Peramonic network (e.g., binary black holes) |
| trinary stars + planets | **Stellar Ternalex < Stellar Ternalexon** | three stars + planets |
| spoken contractions | *quinex*, *ternex* | vowel-prefix elision allowed |

> **Euphonic rule:**  
> When a vowel-ending prefix precedes –lex, the *l* may be dropped (*quinex* < *quinalex*).  
>  
> **Concept:** Lexes express *unity by relationship* — interdependence and function within diversity.

## 4 · Gates — Unity by Context
The suffix **–gate** (from *aggregate*, Latin *aggregare*, “to bring together”) denotes macro-systems composed of multiple Lexes or Cules.  
Gates and **Aggregations** are large-scale, often statistical domains.

| Example | Canonical Term | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| pair of galaxies | **Duagate < Duagation** | binary aggregate |
| triple galaxy system | **Ternate < Ternagation** | triple aggregate |
| galaxy cluster | **Multigate < Multigation** | many-membered aggregate |
| cosmic filament | **Stellagate / Peragate** | vast stellar or peramonic collective |

> **Concept:** Gates express *unity by context* — coherence arising from shared fields or large-scale topology.

## 5 · Summary Hierarchy

| Level | Full form → Common form | Binding principle | Composition | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Monon** | –mon | Identity | singular | planet, star |
| **Cule** | –culon → –cule | Likeness | homogeneous | binary or multiple of same class |
| **Lex** | –lexon → –lex | Connection | heterogeneous | star + planets, planet + moons |
| **Gate** | –gation → –gate | Context | collective field | galaxy, cluster |

## 6 · Conceptual Symmetry
- **–Cule** = *unity by sameness* (kinship)  
- **–Lex** = *unity by difference* (interaction)  
- **–Gate** = *unity by context* (collective field)  

Each suffix is **dimensionless** — it defines the *type of coherence*, not its scale.

> **Monon → Cule → Lex → Gate**  
> — from the One that endures, to the Few that cohere, to the Many that connect, to the Vast that contains.

## The Ontic Classes

All physical bodies (*monons*) in the WCB framework are described along two orthogonal axes:  
their **Ontic class**, which defines scale and self-coherence, and their **Morphological character**, which defines material composition and structure.  

At the broadest scale, all monons fall into one of three Ontic classes governed by the physics of self-gravitation and fusion onset.  
- **Duramons** — all monons with masses below the stellar ignition threshold (**< 0.08 ⊙**); this collective includes every non-fusional body from brown dwarfs and planemons to micromons and asteroids.  
- **Fusamons** — all monons with masses in the stable hydrogen-fusion range (**⟨0.08 ∧ 300⟩ ⊙**); these are subdivided by the **spectral-class system** (q.v.) that defines their thermodynamic and photometric behavior. 
- **Peramons** — all monons whose masses exceed the upper stellar-stability limit (**> 300 ⊙**); these represent the **trans-stellar regime** of radiative instability, pair-creation collapse, or exotic compact states.  

**Ontic Axis (Vertical)**
* Defines scale/mass domain — the degree of self-coherence under gravity.
* Examples: micromons, minimons, planemons, stellamons, untramons.
* Field: Mononics

**Mophological Axis (Horizontal)**
- Defines material/structural composition — what the body is made of.
- Examples: lithic, hydruric, cryic, metalluric.
- Field: Morphotics



### Definitions
- **Morphotype [neo]:** the primary compositional descriptor of a monon — its dominant physical “substance” or structural character (e.g., *lithic*, *argeic*, *hydruric*).  
- **Category / Envelope [meta]:** an emergent classification expressing systemic context and behavior, derived from the combination of a monon’s mass domain and its morphotype (e.g., *geotic*, *telluric*, *xenotic*).  

> **Summary:**  
> The *Mononic axis* quantifies — how massive and self-coherent a body is.  
> The *Morphological axis* qualifies — what the body is made of.  
> The *Categorical envelope* contextualizes — how those traits express within a stellar system.
