### **Distinguishing the Solstitial Angle (Ψ) from the Chronex (ζ)**

Although both Ψ and ζ describe angular relations within an orbit, they refer to *different coordinate frames*:

* The **Solstitial Angle** (Ψ) expresses the *geometric alignment* of a planet’s rotational axis relative to the line of apsides. It marks the orbital longitude at which the planet’s north pole is tilted maximally away from its star — the **prime solstice**.

* The **Chronex** (ζ) expresses the *temporal phase* of the planet’s annual cycle. It marks the true anomaly of the first cardinal seasonal event (**tempostat**) following periastron — the **starting point of the year** in the orbital frame.

The two parameters coincide (*ζ = Ψ*) only when the prime solstice itself defines the year’s beginning.\
Otherwise, ζ differs from Ψ by ±90°, ±180°, etc., depending on which cardinal event initiates the chronum.


<!-- ## Obliquity Orientation ($\zeta$)

The *obliquity orientation* defines the orbital longitude where the planet’s northern hemisphere is tilted directly away from its star.  
If this occurs at **periastron**, then $\zeta = 0^\circ$.

$$
\begin{array}{l r l}
\zeta = &0^\circ & \text{Northern hemisphere tilted directly \textit{away} from the star at periastron.} \\
\zeta = &90^\circ & \text{Tilted away at one-fourth orbit \textit{after} periastron.} \\
\zeta = &180^\circ & \text{Tilted away at one-half orbit \textit{after} periastron (apastron).} \\
\zeta = &270^\circ & \text{Tilted away at three-fourths orbit \textit{after} periastron.}
\end{array}
$$

The value of $\zeta$ may be any angle from 0° to 359°, depending on the planet’s **axial precession**.

The obliquity orientation ($\zeta$) therefore acts as a **phase offset** between the orbit’s eccentric anomaly and the planet’s seasonal cycle, determining whether perihelion aligns with summer or winter in each hemisphere. -->

## Solstitial Angle ($\Psi$)  

The **solstitial angle** describes the angular alignment of a monon’s *precessional orientation* relative to its orbit’s **periaptic axis**.  
It is defined as the angle between **periapsis** (the line of apsides) and the direction in the orbital plane where the planet’s projected **north pole is tilted directly away** from its star — the ***prime solstice***.

$$
\begin{array}{l r l}
\Psi = &0^\circ &\text{periaptic zero: the prime solstice occurs at periastron} \\
\Psi = &90^\circ &\text{the solstitial alignment has precessed $90^\circ$ along the orbit} \\
\Psi = &180^\circ &\text{the prime solstice occurs at apastron} \\
\Psi = &270^\circ &\text{the solstitial alignment has precessed $270^\circ$ forward along the orbit} \\
\end{array}
$$

For notational convenience, the solstitial angle is sometimes indicated by appending the angular measure as a subscript to the symbol, e.g. $\Psi_{90}$ is the same as $\Psi = 90^\circ$.

As axial precession proceeds, $\Psi$ increases anticlockwise with respect to the orbit, so solstices and equinoxes **precess relative to periastron and apastron**.

The **solstitial angle** thus tracks the *slow rotation of the solstitial alignment* around the orbital normal.

The **calendar seasons** remain fixed relative to the planet’s equinoxes and solstices, but their **orbital context** shifts steadily over the precessional cycle.  

This precession occurs for all planets with nonzero obliquity ($\varepsilon \neq 0$) and is independent of tilt magnitude — even an $\varepsilon = 90^\circ$ planet experiences the same drift, with its solstices alternating between periapsis and apastron alignment.
