# Ontic Regimes

##The Binding Domains of Being

> **Ontic Regimes** describe the dominant cohesive forces that define how matter and energy maintain unity.  
> They mark the transition from subatomic to cosmic coherence — from the nucleus that holds together to the star that endures.

| **Regime** | **Binding Force** | **Scale** | **Examples** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Nuclear Regime** | Strong and weak nuclear forces | Atomic nuclei | neutronium, fusion cores |
| **Molecular Regime** | Electromagnetic bonding | Molecular and crystalline matter | lithic, rheic, aeric bodies |
| **Gravitational Regime** | Self-gravitation | Planetary and stellar bodies | planemons, stellamons, peramons |
| **Field Regime** | Energetic or spacetime curvature fields | Relativistic or exotic matter | black holes, cryptomons, hyperstellamons |

Each regime represents a distinct **mode of coherence**, determined by the dominant physical interaction at its scale.  
Together they form the backbone of **Ontic hierarchy**, linking the smallest bound particle to the largest self-coherent body.
