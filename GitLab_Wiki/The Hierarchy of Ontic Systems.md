## The Ontic Classes

All physical bodies (*monons*) in the WMB framework are described along two orthogonal axes:  
their **Ontic class**, which defines scale and self-coherence, and their **Morphological character**, which defines material composition and structure.  

At the broadest scale, all monons fall into one of three Ontic classes governed by the physics of self-gravitation and fusion onset.  
- **Duramons** — all monons with masses below the stellar ignition threshold (**< 0.08 ⊙**); this collective includes every non-fusional body from brown dwarfs and planemons to micromons and asteroids.  
- **Fusamons** — all monons with masses in the stable hydrogen-fusion range (**⟨0.08 ∧ 300⟩ ⊙**); these are subdivided by the **spectral-class system** (q.v.) that defines their thermodynamic and photometric behavior. 
- **Peramons** — all monons whose masses exceed the upper stellar-stability limit (**> 300 ⊙**); these represent the **trans-stellar regime** of radiative instability, pair-creation collapse, or exotic compact states.  

**Ontic Axis (Vertical)**
* Defines scale/mass domain — the degree of self-coherence under gravity.
* Examples: micromons, minimons, planemons, stellamons, untramons.
* Field: Mononics

**Mophological Axis (Horizontal)**
- Defines material/structural composition — what the body is made of.
- Examples: lithic, hydruric, cryic, metalluric.
- Field: Morphotics



### Definitions
- **Morphotype [neo]:** the primary compositional descriptor of a monon — its dominant physical “substance” or structural character (e.g., *lithic*, *argeic*, *hydruric*).  
- **Category / Envelope [meta]:** an emergent classification expressing systemic context and behavior, derived from the combination of a monon’s mass domain and its morphotype (e.g., *geotic*, *telluric*, *xenotic*).  

> **Summary:**  
> The *Mononic axis* quantifies — how massive and self-coherent a body is.  
> The *Morphological axis* qualifies — what the body is made of.  
> The *Categorical envelope* contextualizes — how those traits express within a stellar system.
