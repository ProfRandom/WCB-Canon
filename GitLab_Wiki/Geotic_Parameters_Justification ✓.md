# Justifying The Geotic Limits
In establishing the boundaries of the Geotic classification, we confront not merely a technical exercise in parameter selection but a philosophical act of declaration. These limits—defined in terms of mass, density, surface gravity, radius, and escape velocity—do not emerge arbitrarily from equations alone. They are sculpted from the convergence of empirical data, biological insight, and an interpretive philosophy of life’s tolerances: an ontological bridge between observation and valuation.

The Geotic envelope is broad enough to encompass worlds plausibly habitable to Earthlike life, yet not so wide as to dilute the concept of habitability into meaninglessness. The limits are drawn to include known extremes of terrestrial endurance — lower gravities where the human body remains functional, higher ones where it still stands upright; densities reflecting silicate-rich compositions without slipping into degenerate matter; radii that allow for diverse tectonics and geochemistry, yet remain below the gas giant threshold.

These ranges are further filtered through a mirandothesiastic sieve — one that refuses to separate scientific measure from lived perspective. We acknowledge the Anthropic Principle not as an excuse, but as a lens: life emerges within certain ranges because those ranges make life like us possible. The limits of what we call *Geotic* reflect both the statistical plausibility of terrestrial-like biology and the philosophical humility to admit that even our constraints are narrative choices shaped by experience.

To be Geotic is to stand within the habitable corridor of possibility — not at the narrow peak of Earth-perfect parameters (Gaean), nor flung to exotic extremes (Xenotic). It is the threshold of plausibility for Earthlike life in a cosmos that offers no guarantees but countless invitations.
