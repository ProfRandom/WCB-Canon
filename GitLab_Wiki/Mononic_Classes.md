## The Mononic Classes

All physical bodies (*monons*) in the WCB framework are described along two orthogonal axes:  
their **Mononic class**, which defines scale and self-coherence,  
and their **Morphological character**, which defines material composition and structure.  

> At the broadest scale, all monons fall into one of three **mass domains** governed by the physics of self-gravitation and fusion onset.  
> - **Duramons** — all monons with masses below the stellar ignition threshold (**< 0.08 ⊙**); this collective includes every non-fusional body from brown dwarfs and planemons to micromons and asteroids.  
> - **Stellamons** — all monons with masses in the stable hydrogen-fusion range (**⟨0.08 ∧ 300⟩ ⊙**); these are subdivided by the **spectral-class system** (q.v.) that defines their thermodynamic and photometric behavior. 
> - **Peramons** — all monons whose masses exceed the upper stellar-stability limit (**> 300 ⊙**); these represent the **trans-stellar regime** of radiative instability, pair-creation collapse, or exotic compact states.  
>  
> Together, these three domains describe the **Mononic Continuum** from sub-stellar to trans-stellar mass, uniting all self-gravitating bodies under a single hierarchical grammar.

A third, contextual layer — the **Categorical Envelope** — arises from the interaction of the two.

**Mononic Axis (Vertical)**
* Defines scale/mass domain — the degree of self-coherence under gravity.
* Examples: micromons, minimons, planemons, stellamons, untramons.
* Field: Mononics

**Mophological Axis (Horizontal)**
- Defines material/structural composition — what the body is made of.
- Examples: lithic, hydruric, cryic, metalluric.
- Field: Morphology

**Categorical/Environmental Envelope**
- Defines the contextual synthesis of mononic class and dominant morphotype.
- Examples: geotic, telluric, argeic, xenotic

### Examples
- **Earth:** lithic planemon → *geotic* category.  
- **Jupiter:** aeric planemon → *haliform* category.  
- **Ceres:** hydruric minimon → *asteroidal* category.  

### Definitions
- **Morphotype [neo]:** the primary compositional descriptor of a monon — its dominant physical “substance” or structural character (e.g., *lithic*, *argeic*, *hydruric*).  
- **Category / Envelope [meta]:** an emergent classification expressing systemic context and behavior, derived from the combination of a monon’s mass domain and its morphotype (e.g., *geotic*, *telluric*, *xenotic*).  

> **Summary:**  
> The *Mononic axis* quantifies — how massive and self-coherent a body is.  
> The *Morphological axis* qualifies — what the body is made of.  
> The *Categorical envelope* contextualizes — how those traits express within a stellar system.
