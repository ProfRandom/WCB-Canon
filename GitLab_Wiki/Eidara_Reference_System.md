# The Eidara Reference System

**Eidara** is the canonical *World Crafting Basics* reference system — a balanced, habitable world and its parent star, used as the model for all practical equations, demonstrations, and systemic relationships across the Canon.

It provides a single, internally consistent framework through which *Ontic*, *Metric*, and *Descriptive* principles can be illustrated without cross-file inconsistency.  
Just as physics textbooks use the Earth–Sun–Moon system for examples, WCB uses **Eidara** and its sunlike **fusamon** as the universal reference.

## Ontic Definition

Eidara is a **duramonic monon** within a **fusamonic system**, exhibiting a single, stable **center of mass** and full **self-coherence** under gravitational binding.  
It serves as the standard example of a *lithic–rheic ontic body* capable of hosting animotic equilibrium within a stable milieutic context.

## Descriptive Expression Across the Seven Domains

| **Domain** | **Focus in Eidara System** |
|:--|:--|
| **Ontics** | Defines Eidara as a duramonic monon orbiting a G-class fusamon; one moon; single barycenter. |
| **Categorics** | Member of a single-star, two-planet system with moderate resonance and a stable dynamical hierarchy. |
| **Metrics** | Provides the canonical normalization for all WCB unit examples (1 Eidara = 1 E⊕). |
| **Morphotics** | Slightly oblate lithic–rheic sphere with polar flattening and seasonal symmetry. |
| **Conformics** | Lithic crust, rheic mantle, metallic core, aeric atmosphere; stable solid–liquid–gas equilibrium. |
| **Animotics** | Biotic Order (Gaean Province): carbon–water vitality within temperature range 250–320 K. |
| **Milieutics** | Inner-habitable orbital zone with balanced tidal, radiative, and rotational dynamics; climatically temperate. |

## Narrative Context

> **Eidara** represents the *centerline of plausibility* in WCB design.  
> It is neither extreme nor idealized — the benchmark of environmental stability, physical coherence, and animotic potential.  
> Every comparative parameter (luminosity, mass, orbital distance, etc.) is expressed relative to Eidara units for narrative and mathematical consistency.

**Example use:**  
- When deriving equations for orbital period, use $a_{Eidara}$ = 1.10 AU as the baseline.  
- When defining equilibrium temperatures, $T_{eq,Eidara}$ = 279 K becomes the nominal “temperate reference.”  
- All derived energies, luminosities, and surface gravities normalize to Eidara values unless explicitly noted.
