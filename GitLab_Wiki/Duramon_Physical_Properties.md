# Physical Properties of Duramons

There are five properties of duraons that can be thought of as *physical properties* — insofar as they describe the duramon physically or a property of the duramon that emerges from the other physical properties.  These are:

1. ***Mass*** (m):  The total amount of matter present. (*Mass and weight are not the same — weight depends on gravity; mass does not*.)
2. ***Density*** (ρ):  The average amount of matter per unit volume — essentially, how tightly packed the duramon's materials are. This depends on both composition (e.g. rock, ice, metal) and, for larger bodies, gravitational self-compression.
3. ***Radius*** (r):  The distance from the duramon’s center to its surface.  Technically, this is derived from the duramon’s mass and average density — but more on this in a moment.
4. ***Surface Gravity*** (g):  The strength of gravitational acceleration at the duramon’s surface — how strongly it attracts objects located one radius away from its center.
5. ***Escape Velocity*** (v): The minimum speed needed to completely escape the duramon’s gravity when starting from the surface — how much velocity is required to leave the duramon entirely.

These are all intricately interrelated in ways that are much more complicated than we need to account for here.  For instance, while **radius** *is* derived from **mass** and **density**, it also matters how strongly the mass of the duramon is gravitationally acting on itself.  This causes ***gravitational compression***, which means that the matter is forced into a denser configuration than it would otherwise exhibit *if it were not under such intense gravitational pull*.  So, it is also true that **density** in some sense is derived from **mass** and **radius**.

Surface gravity and escape velocity are also very dependent on both mass and radius.  The farther a point on the surface of the duramon is from the duramon's center, the less gravitational attraction from the duramon it experiences, decreasing according to the ***inverse-square law*** (more on this later).  And the weaker the surface gravity, the less energy it takes to overcome it, so the lower the escape velocity.

For our purposes, it is reasonable to simplify things and say:

> Radius is an *emergent property* of the interaction of mass and density.

... and not be too overly concerned about the subtleties.

>  **Keppy**: *Sed ego dico*, right?

Yes; this is our first official invocation of *sed ego dico*, "because I say".  No, it's not *entirely physically accurate*, but it's good enough for what we need to accomplish.

Mass and density are also dependent upon what materials the duramon is made of: most duramons are composed of several materials (rock, ice, liquid water, etc.).  Rock, itself, can composed of any number of more basic elements and compounds.

And all of these materials have their own inherent densities.  Water, for instance, has a density of about 1.0 g/cm³ (and is, in fact the *standard* for material density in the metric system we're using.)   Iron, on the other hand, has a density of about 7.7 g/cm³  — almost eight times that of water.  So 1 kilogram of water takes up more volume than one kilogram of iron.

> There is an old riddle, which was a favorite of my maternal grandfather: "Which is heavier — a pound of iron or a pound of feathers?"  The trick to the question, of course, is that both *weigh* a pound, but because feathers are less dense than iron, that pound (in its natural state) takes up far more volume than does the iron.
