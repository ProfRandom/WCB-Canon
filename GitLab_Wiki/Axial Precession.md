# Precession
*Note that this is a measure of the time it takes the obliquity to complete one full rotational cycle.*

- **Precession Period** *($\psi$)* —
  The duration of one full cycle of the precession of the equinoxes.
 - NOTE that $\psi = 0$ if $\varepsilon = 0$

For Earth:

$$
\psi = 25{,}772
$$
