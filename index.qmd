# Preface

Welcome to the **WorldCrafting Canon**, the evolving reference framework for the physical, cosmological, and mythosophical principles underlying the Myndhre setting.

This development build includes preliminary and canonical notes spanning:
- Meta-frameworks and mathematical tools,
- Stellar and planetary structures,
- Orbital dynamics,
- Mononic classifications,
- Binary systems,
- and supporting phonetic and terminological standards.
