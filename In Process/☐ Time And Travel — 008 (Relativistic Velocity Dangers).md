# The Dangers of Relativistic Velocities
## Catastrophic Impacts From Microparticles
While your environment onboard ship feels "normal" to you, the Lorentz factor has had its effects on the "outside" universe.  A dust particle that would be practically massless under "normal" circumstances may have several tons of relativistic mass if it hits your ship.

So, any vessel traversing at relativistic speeds needs to be protected from the energy release of any such impacts on its hull.  The necessary thickness (and mass that has to be accelerated) of a physical shield grows as a function of the Lorentz factor as velocity increases, so a point of diminishing returns is reached almost instantly.

In many science fiction milieux, this problem is avoided by either of two means:
1. Either the ship is in a "bubble" of some kind, the nature of which absorbs or deflects any such incoming missles; or
2. The ship is fitted with some kind of energetic field of force (commonly called a "shield") which either deflects the impactors or absorbs the energy of their collision with it.

## The View Out The Window
First, it would depend entirely on which window you were looking out of.

1. Light from the stars behind you would become progressively more redshifted as your velocity increased, until they became invisible to the naked eye.  Objects previously radiating in the ultraviolet would gradually become visible and grow redder until they, too, passed beyond the visible red end of the spectrum.
2. Light from the stars ahead of you would become progressively more blue-shifted toward the ultraviolet.  Those already radiating in the violet end of the spectrum would disappear from view.  Objects previously only radiating in long wavelengths below red would emerge into the visible spectrum, progressively grow bluer, and finally, they, too would pass out of the visible range into the ultraviolet.  The light coming toward you would also become progressively more and more energetic until it was as if you were stationary at some finite distance from the Big Bang, itself.
3. Light from the stars out the side windows would be similarly shifted, to a greater or lesser extent depending on how far away from you they were.  Ultimately, all the light arriving at your location would become compressed into a rainbow like a belt around your ship (at no measurable distance_, with utter blackness "ahead" and "behind" it.  Red would be at the "back" end, violet at the "front" end, and the other colors of the spectrum distributed between the two extremes.

And you probably wouldn't want to be looking out a glass window, anyway, because you'd be microwaved or gamma rayed before you had a chance to marvel at the spectacle.
