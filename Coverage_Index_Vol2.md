## 📌 Notes
- **Strong coverage:** Apparent Brightness, Solar Analogs, Habitable Zones, Binary Systems.  
- **Partials:** Spectral Types (needs text), Stellar Populations (luminosity classes incomplete).  
- **Gaps:** Nature of Stars, Stellar Frequency, Fundamental Orbits and Limits.  
- **Equation Compilation** can be dropped as redundant.
