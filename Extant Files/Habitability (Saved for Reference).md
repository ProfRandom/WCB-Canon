## Abstract 1
**Major Topics:** 
- Exploration of what defines an “Earth-like” planemon.
- Reference baseline: Earth’s absolute physical parameters (mass, radius, density, gravity, escape velocity).
- Lack of consensus in astrophysics: ranges vs. environmental conditions.
- Distinction between **physical similarity** and **habitability classifications** (habitable, parahabitable, hospitable, xenotic, exotic).

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- m = mass (Earth: 5.972 × 10²⁴ kg).
- r = radius (Earth: 6371 km).
- ρ = density (Earth: 5.514 g/cm³).
- g = surface gravity (Earth: 9.8 m/s²).
- vₑ = escape velocity (Earth: 11.186 km/s).
- “Earth-like” = physical conformity, not animosustent criteria.

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- Reinforces WCB convention: lowercase symbols (m, r) for planemon parameters.
- Distinguish clearly between **Earth-like (physical)** and **animocentric classifications** (habitable, parahabitable, hospitable, xenotic, exotic).
- Connects to glossary entries: animosustent (canon v1.21), planemon parameters.
- Prevent conflation of “Earth-like” with life-supporting qualities.

## Abstract 2
**Major Topics:** 
- Demonstrates why Venus, despite meeting **Geotic Envelope** physical criteria, fails **Gaean classification**.
- Venus as **Geotic**: 
 - Mass (0.815 ⨁), radius (0.949 ⨁), density (0.95 ⨁), gravity (0.90 ⨁), escape velocity (0.93 ⨁).
 - All values fall within Geotic bounds, making Venus structurally Earthlike.
- Venus not **Gaean**: 
 - Atmosphere: 92 atm CO₂ with sulfuric acid aerosols.
 - Surface temperature: ~735 K (462 °C), runaway greenhouse effect.
 - Magnetosphere: lacks intrinsic magnetic field.
 - Hydrosphere: no stable surface water.
- Concludes that physical plausibility (Geotic) must be separated from habitability (Gaean).
- Illustrates WCB taxonomy: **not all Geotics are Gaeans**.

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **Geotic [sci].** 
- **Gaean [sci].** 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- Both Geotic and Gaean are already canonical.
- This file provides a case study reinforcing the distinction.
- **Status:** [EXPANDED] — applies existing canon to Venus as a worked example.

## Abstract 3
**Major Topics:** 
- Extended parameters for defining geotic (human-hospitable) conditions.
- Habitability ranges for rotation period (D), orbital eccentricity (e), orbital period (C), axial tilt (εₓ), precession cycle (χ), and obliquity azimuth (ζₙ).
- Magnetosphere strength (Bsurf) as radiation shielding criterion.
- Atmospheric baseline conditions: pressure, scale height, composition, ozone presence.
- Surface balance of land and water.
- Geotic gravity corridor (0.5–1.5 ⨁) as strict human-hospitable bound.

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **D** — Rotational period (diurn length).
- **e** — Orbital eccentricity.
- **C** — Orbital period (sidereal chronum).
- **εₓ** — Axial tilt (obliquity).
- **χ** — Axial precession cycle.
- **ζₙ** — Obliquity azimuth relative to periapsis.
- **Bsurf** — Surface magnetic field strength (μT).
- **Tₛ** — Average surface temperature (K).
- **H** — Atmospheric scale height (km). 
- **g** — Surface gravity (⨁). 
- Land–sea distribution (lithosphere–hydrosphere balance). 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- Reinforces prior geotic bounds with expanded atmospheric, rotational, orbital, and magnetic criteria. 
- Clarifies *why* gravity corridor (0.5–1.5 ⨁) defines Geotic worlds: outside this, planemons may be Telluric/parahabitable but not Geotic. 
- Orbital period C not freely chosen: constrained by Kepler’s Third Law, tying world design to stellar parameters. 
- Magnetosphere thresholds emphasize that both too weak and too strong fields can undermine habitability. 
- Complements and extends core Geotic definitions; functions as a reference sheet for designers setting secondary parameters. 

## Abstract 4 
**Major Topics:** 
- Establishes rationale for the **parahabitable envelope**: 
 $$
 \text{parameter} \in \langle0.5 \wedge 1.5\rangle \oplus
 $$ 
 for the five foundational parameters (m, ρ, g, r, vₑ). 
- Argues this range balances **biological tolerance** with **civilizational viability** — survivability, infrastructure, and long-term stability. 
- Justifies limits for each parameter by examining consequences of values below ≈0.5 ⨁ or above ≈1.5 ⨁. 

### Parameter-Specific Justifications 
- **Mass:** 
 - <0.5 ⨁ → atmosphere loss, weak magnetosphere, tectonic shutdown. 
 - >1.5 ⨁ → runaway pressures, volatile over-retention, hostile chemistry, tech suppression. 
- **Density:** 
 - <0.5 ⨁ → volatile-rich ice/gas mix, poor tectonics, weak magnetosphere. 
 - >1.5 ⨁ → iron-heavy compact worlds, stagnant lid tectonics, biomechanical barriers. 
- **Gravity:** 
 - <0.5 ⨁ → thin atmosphere, poor shielding, fluid/chemical instability. 
 - >1.5 ⨁ → compressive barriers to life, atmosphere flattening, biochemical inhibition. 
- **Radius:** 
 - <0.8 ⨁ → compact/iron-rich, short tectonic lifespans. 
 - >1.2 ⨁ → volatile-rich/iceball-class, poor atmospheric retention. 
- **Escape Velocity (vₑ):** 
 - <0.5 ⨁ (≈5.6 km/s) → thermal escape, atmosphere loss. 
 - >1.5 ⨁ (≈16.8 km/s) → volatile over-retention, crushing pressures, runaway greenhouse, tech bottlenecks. 

### Superhabitables 
- Introduces **Superhabitable worlds**: planemons potentially *more conducive to life than Earth*. 
- Traits: slightly higher mass (1.2–2.0 ⨁), moderate density (0.8–1.1 ⨁), g ≈ 1.1–1.4 ⨁, long tectonic lifespans, stronger magnetospheres, larger/ecologically diverse surfaces, thicker atmospheres. 
- Not “superhuman-friendly” — may be hostile for humans but rich for biospheres. 
- Shows habitability is a **plateau, not a peak**: higher mass can create opportunities, not just risks. 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **Parahabitable Envelope** — ⟨0.5–1.5⟩ ⨁ range across core parameters. 
- **Superhabitable planemons** — Worlds optimized for life’s flourishing, not human comfort

## Abstract 5
**Major Topics:** 
- Relationship between **land–water distribution** and planetary climate. 
- Effects of different **continental/oceanic ratios** on atmospheric circulation, precipitation, and long-term habitability. 
- Classification of hydrospheric patterns: aquaplanets, thalassoplanets, continental planets, mixed/ocean-hemisphere worlds. 
- Impact of **polar vs. equatorial land placement** on ice caps, climate stability, and water cycle feedbacks. 
- Worldbuilding guidelines for how water distribution influences **biospheric richness** and **geotic/gaean habitability envelopes**. 

**Key Terms & Symbols:** 
- **Aquaplanet** — world with near-total ocean coverage. 
- **Thalassoplanet** — ocean-dominated planet with small landmasses. 
- **Continental planet** — land-dominated planet with limited water. 
- **Mixed pattern** — intermediate distribution of land and water. 
- **Hydrospheric balance** — ratio of oceanic to continental coverage, often expressed as a percentage. 
- **Cryosphere** — ice-covered portions of the hydrosphere, strongly latitude-dependent. 

**Cross-Check Notes:** 
- Connects directly with **Gaean planemons** (Earth-like envelope definition) and **Geotic Guidelines** (extended habitability). 
- Provides *pattern-based classification*, useful alongside **Ground States** and **Rheatic planemons**. 
- No explicit new symbols; introduces several neolexical classifications (*thalassoplanet, aquaplanet*). 
- Stages additional glossary updates for **hydrospheric balance** and related world types.
