## Abstract  
**Major Topics:**  
- Establishes the **five core physical and emergent parameters** defining a monon‚Äôs measurable state:  
  - **Mass (m):** total quantity of matter.  
  - **Density (œÅ):** uncompressed material density, independent of self-gravity.  
  - **Surface Gravity (g):** acceleration experienced at the monon‚Äôs surface.  
  - **Escape Velocity (v‚Çë):** minimum speed needed to overcome the monon‚Äôs gravity.  
  - **Radius (r):** emergent quantity derived from m and œÅ.  
- Clarifies the **hierarchical dependency** among parameters:  
  - *Physical parameters* (m, œÅ) are composition-driven.  
  - *Experiential parameters* (g, v‚Çë) derive from m and œÅ.  
  - *Emergent parameter* (r) is computed from both, closing the causal loop.  
- Defines the **WCB symbolic mass interval system**, dividing monon masses by powers of ten relative to Earth (‚®Å):  
  - Extends from **deniterran (10‚Åª¬π‚Å∞ ‚®Å)** through **teraterran (10¬π¬≤ ‚®Å)**.  
  - Introduces the **microterran scale (Œºt)** for clarity in the 10‚Åª‚Å∂‚Äì10‚Åª¬π ‚®Å range.  
  - Notes SI alignment where standard prefixes exist (micro-, milli-, kilo-, mega-, etc.).  
- Explains the **Geotic envelope** ‚ü®0.5 ‚àß 1.5‚ü© ‚®Å as the physical and biological gravity corridor for human-habitable worlds.  
- Demonstrates that computed g, v‚Çë, and r values from Geotic-range m and œÅ remain within acceptable limits.  
- Emphasizes **WCB simplification conventions**:  
  - Density is uncompressed to prevent recursive equations of state.  
  - Radius is not freely assigned but emerges from m and œÅ.  
  - ‚ÄúSed ego dico‚Äù invoked for practical modeling over physical exactitude.

**Key Terms & Symbols:**  
- **m, œÅ, g, v‚Çë, r** ‚Äî core monon parameters.  
- **Symbolic mass intervals [neo].**  
- **Microterran scale (Œºt) [neo].**  
- **Geotic range ‚ü®0.5 ‚àß 1.5‚ü© ‚®Å [sci].**  
- **Uncompressed density (œÅ‚ÇÄ) [conv].**  
- **Sed ego dico [meta].**

**Cross-Check Notes:**  
- Supersedes previous abstracts 1 and 6 by consolidating physical parameters and symbolic mass systems.  
- Excludes range-constraint and randomization rules (now in *Meta 2 ‚Äî Math Tools*).  
- Integrates habitability and magnetic-field criteria through references to *Planemons 2* and *Stars 6*.  
- Reinforces consistency between Monon equations (*Monons 1 ‚Äî Framework and Equations*) and the geotic envelope.


# Principle of Mass Measurement

> **Monon masses are purely numerically defined.**  
> They **measure** a body's physical magnitude; they do **not categorize** or **qualify** its nature or type.

The following table defines the **official WCB symbolic mass intervals** ‚Äî logarithmic divisions of monon mass based on powers of ten relative to Earth (‚®Å). These are used for measurement and comparison only. They are **not categorical classes**, and do **not imply world type**.

> Notes:
> 1. Where official SI prefixes exist (e.g. micro-, milli-, deci-, centi-, kilo-, mega-, giga-, tera-, peta-, exa-), WCB uses them directly.
> 2. For intermediate powers without SI prefixes, WCB adopts consistent **neologisms** based on the exponent‚Äôs magnitude:.
> 	‚Ä¢ Exponents **below zero** use an **-i** ending (unless overridden by SI, e.g. *micro*, not *micri*).
> 	‚Ä¢ Exponents **above zero** use an **-o** ending (unless overridden by SI, e.g. *mega*, not *mego*).
> 3. While SI defines prefixes beyond **tera-** (e.g. *peta-*, *exa-*), WCB does not typically use them in monon contexts. Even the observable universe spans only ~46.5 **giga**lightyears (Gly) in radius ‚Äî three orders of magnitude short of **teraterran** mass or volume relevance.
> 4. Conversely, the **negative intervals are symbolically essential**, as many moons, asteroids, and micro-monons fall well below 1‚ÄØ‚®Å in mass. It is often more meaningful to say
> 	‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThe body is **1 microterran** (Œº‚®Å)‚Äù
> 		$\qquad$than
> 	‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThe body is **0.000001‚ÄØ‚®Å**‚Äù.
> 5. For **practical purposes**, WCB defines the upper bound of each mass interval as **one demiterran (0.00001‚ÄØ‚®Å)** below the next power of ten.
> 	‚Ä¢ In other words, the *terran* interval spans from **1.0‚ÄØ‚®Å to 9.99999‚ÄØ‚®Å**. 
> 	‚Ä¢ Any value exceeding that threshold ‚Äî even slightly ‚Äî is considered to **round up** to the next symbolic interval.
> 		‚Ä¢ **Example:**
> 		$\qquad$ 9.9999901‚ÄØ‚®Å ‚Üí **10.0‚ÄØ‚®Å**, placing the body in the **dekaterran** interval.
> 6. The **deniterran** is the lowest mass on this scale because objects below this mass are not capable of achieving hydrostatic equilibrium under their own gravity.
> 7.  The exaterran is the largest mass on this scale, corresponding to the realistic upper limit for Ultra-massive Black Holes (UMBHs), about $10^{12}$‚äô masses.


### Interpretive Guidance
- 

# Estimating Planetary Magnetospheres
- **Magnetic moment (M)** and how it relates to $B_{surf}$
- Empirical scaling relationships (e.g., from Stevenson or Driscoll & Olson models)
- A simplified proportional form like:

$$
B_{surf} \propto \left(\dfrac{\rho_c}{\rho_\oplus}\right)^p \times \left(\dfrac{r_c}{r_\oplus}\right)^q \times \left(\dfrac{1}{d}\right)^r
$$

   Where:
-  $r_c$ = core radius
- $\rho_c$ = core density
- $d$ = day length (rotation period)
- $p, q, r$ are empirical exponents from dynamo scaling studies

This is a **scaling law approximation** from monon dynamo theory ‚Äî useful, but absolutely needing context.

 üß™ **Where This Comes From (Briefly)**

This form is adapted from scaling relations used by geophysicists and monon scientists (e.g., Olson & Christensen, Stevenson, Driscoll & Bercovici), who try to predict magnetic field strength based on **internal structure and heat flow**.

Values of $p$, $q$, and $r$ vary depending on assumptions about:
- Core thermal convection mode (thermal vs. compositional)
- Rotational regime (rapid vs. slow)
- Efficiency of magnetic field generation

 üß≠ **Rule-of-Thumb Exponent Ranges**


| Exponent | Typical Value (approx.) | Notes                                                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $p$      | ‚ü®1.0 ‚àß 1.3‚ü©            | Reflects that higher-density cores produce stronger magnetic energy    |
| $q$      | ‚ü®2.0 ‚àß 2.5‚ü©            | Core radius has a strong effect ‚Äî bigger cores mean more dynamo volume |
| $r$      | ‚ü®1.0 ‚àß 1.5‚ü©            | Faster spin increases field strength, up to saturation                 |

These aren't exact, but they give a ballpark for building **comparative models** ‚Äî e.g.:

> ‚ÄúA world with a core 1.2√ó Earth‚Äôs radius, 1.1√ó Earth‚Äôs core density, and a 16-hour day could have a magnetic field **2‚Äì3√ó stronger** than Earth‚Äôs, all else equal.‚Äù

Or simply provide example profiles:

- Earth: œÅ = 1.0‚®Å, d = 24h ‚Üí $B_{surf}$ ‚àà ‚ü®25 ‚àß 65> ŒºT
- Super-Earth: œÅ = 1.3‚®Å, d = 16h ‚Üí $B_{surf}$ ‚àà ‚ü®80 ..120‚ü© ŒºT
- Mars: œÅ = 0.71‚®Å, d = 24.6h ‚Üí $B_{surf}$ ‚âà 0 ŒºT (solid core)

> **Keppy**: Uh... wow.  Not sure what to make of all that, frankly.

Yes, that's a lot.

> **Keppy**: Can these be calculated for a fictional world?

Some; most not easily.  Others are completely independent of the physical parameters (and each other, come to that).  We can set some rules of thumb, as it were.

## Extended Parameter Details

**Rotational period/Length of diurn (D)**
- D ‚àà ‚ü®6 ∞ ‚àß 120·µà‚ü© ‚Äî General Geotic Range
	- D ‚àà ‚ü®6 ∞ ‚àß 48 ∞‚ü© ‚Äî Human-adaptable; supports familiar circadian rhythms
    - D ‚àà ‚ü®2·µà ‚àß 20·µà‚ü© ‚Äî Mild extremes; thermal contrast can be buffered with atmosphere or oceans 
    - D ‚àà ‚ü®20·µà ‚àß 100·µà‚ü© ‚Äî Edge cases; require mitigation (dense atmosphere, global hydrosphere)
    - D ‚àà ‚ü®100·µà ‚àß 120·µà‚ü© ‚Äî Rare survivable zone
        - Habitability hinges on:
            - Efficient heat distribution (atmosphere or oceans)
            - Slow stellar heating (distant or cool star)
            - Non-volatile surface conditions
- Beyond 120·µà, the temperature contrast between day and night becomes too extreme for habitability **without technological aid** (which puts in the *parahabitable* spectrum).  
	- Even a perfect ocean‚Äìatmosphere system may fail to smooth the thermal tide.  
	- monons in this range may be Tellurics, but they are *not* Geotics.

> **Keppy**: Do we know what other (if any) of a monon's physical parameters may affect its rotational period?

As a matter of fact, astrophysicists are beginning to **simulate probable spin states** for Earth-like exoplanets under different formation conditions. A few recurring themes:
- Tidal locking is expected for monons in the habitable zones of **M-dwarfs**, due to proximity.
- Initial rotation rates may depend on:
    - Accretion history
    - Giant impacts (e.g., the Moon-forming event)
    - Early tidal evolution
- **Resonant rotations**
	- Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit resonance may be **more common than full tidal locking**
- Close-in monons may be more likely **spin slowly or be tidally locked**
- Moons (especially those whose mass is a significant fraction of the monon's) can stabilize or slow a monon's rotation rate
	- This is happening with Earth; our day is lengthening by ‚âà 17 microseconds per year, or 1 second every 58800 years
- Giant impacts can reset rotation direction and/or speed

**Orbital Eccentricity (e)**
- e ‚àà ‚ü®0 ‚àß 0.25‚ü© ‚Äî General Geotic Tolerance
- e ‚àà ‚ü®0.01 ‚àß 0.10‚ü© ‚Äî Earth-clone ideal range
	- In multi-monon systems, stable configurations usually result in e < 0.10 per monon
	- In single-monon (only-child) or widely spaced systems, values up to e ‚âà 0.25 may remain dynamically stable, but tend to reduce overall habitability
	- Risks of e > 0.25
		- Large insolation differentials between periastron and apastron
		- Pronounced climatic volatility
		- Less likelihood of maintaining **persistent, stable biospheres**
		- Increased vulnerability to **orbital perturbations**
		- Possible **transit through and out of the system's habitable zone (HZ)** during a single orbit
			- Note: On a world with zero axial tilt (Œµ = 0), high eccentricity might act as a surrogate for seasonal variation ‚Äî producing orbit-phase-based temperature cycles.  This is *technically viable*, but requires very careful tuning of orbital shape, atmospheric thermal inertia, and surface conditions to avoid extreme or catastrophic conditions.

**Orbital Period (C)**
- This parameter **can't be freely chosen** ‚Äî it's governed by **Kepler's Third Law**, originally formulated as $$P^2 \propto a^3$$and later regularized by Newton to account for the total mass of the system
- The orbital period depends on both the distance of the monon's orbit and the *combined masses of the star(s) and monon*.
$$C = \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M + m}}$$
where:
- C = the orbital period of the monon in perannum
- a = the monon's orbit's **semi-major axis** in ***Astronomical Units***
- M = the mass of the star in solar units (‚äô)
- m = the mass of the monon (also in solar units)
- In most systems, m ¬´ M and can be neglected for quick calculations:
$$C = \sqrt{\dfrac{a^3}{M}}$$	...However, if the monon's mass exceeds ‚âà 10% of the mass of the star(s), its contribution to the period of its orbit begins to have noticeable effects.  This is especially relevant for:
		- Super-Jovian mass monons orbiting red-dwarf stars (q.v.)
		- Binary monon systems
			- See *Sidebar Module ‚Äì Two-body Systems*
			- See also *Sidebar Module ‚Äì Double-monon or monon-moon*?

- I include *C* here not because it's adjustable, but because it‚Äôs **crucial to the seasonal dynamics** of a world:
    - It modulates how **axial tilt ($\varepsilon_x$)** and **eccentricity (e)** express over time
    - It defines the **length of seasons**, and whether rotation (D) is **fast or slow relative to the year**  
    - It affects the **precession timescale (œá)** through long-term resonances
- In short: *IF* you *declare C*, that choice *constrains what kind of star your system can have*.
	- See *Sidebar Module ‚Äì Stars, Planetary Orbits, and Habitable Zones* for details
- *Note that the masses of other monons in the system have no effect in this equation!*

**Obliquity (Axial tilt) ($\varepsilon_x$)**
- $\varepsilon_x$ ‚àà ‚ü®0¬∞ ‚àß 5¬∞‚ü© ‚Äî Negligible seasonal variation
- $\varepsilon_x$ ‚àà ‚ü®15¬∞ ‚àß 35¬∞‚ü© ‚Äî Plausible range for active seasonal variation
- $\varepsilon_x$ ‚àà ‚ü®20¬∞ ‚àß 30¬∞‚ü© ‚Äî Earth-normal like
- $\varepsilon_x$ ‚àà ‚ü®35¬∞ ‚àß 45¬∞‚ü© ‚Äî Extreme seasonal variation unless mitigated by atmosphere/oceans
- $\varepsilon_x$ > 45¬∞ ‚Äî Potentially unstable
	- Polar and tropical regions actually reverse!

A monon does not *have* to have an axial tilt, but most do, because their mass isn't evenly distributed throughout their volume, and that mass is tugged on by the host star(s), companion Moons, other monons in their star system, etc.

**Precession Cycle (œá)**
- œá ‚àà ‚ü®15 ‚àß 60‚ü© ky ‚Äî General Geotics range
- œá ‚àà ‚ü®20 ‚àß 30‚ü© ky ‚Äî Earth-clone ideal range
	- Note: If your monon has an axial tilt ($\varepsilon_x ‚â† 0$), it *will* have an axial precession period.
- < 5 ky
	- Too fast
	- Rapid climatic swings
	- Possibly preventive of long-term stable ecosystems
- 5 ‚Äì 15 ky
	- Can support meaningful precession cycles
	- More frequent variation
- 20 ‚Äì 30 ky
	- Earth-normal range
	- Ideal for familar Milankovitch-style climate pacing
- 30 ‚Äì 60 ky
	- Acceptible
	- Modulates long-term climate, but with slower variability
- > 60 ky
	- May mute precessional influence
	- monon becomes dependent on *Œµ* or *e* (or a combination) for seasonal variation
- Habitability-Relevant Impacts of Axial Precession
	- Precession alone doesn't cause climate variation‚Äîbut it *modulates* how obliquity and eccentricity combine with seasons.
	- Precession rate is influenced by monon tilt, mass distribution, rotation rate, and gravitational interactions (especially from moons or nearby monons).
	- Moderately long precessional periods (25‚Äì30 kyr) help establish stable, regular Milankovitch cycles conducive to long-term ecosystem resilience. 
	- Affected by:
		- Axial tilt ($\varepsilon_x$) ‚Äî higher tilts tend to precess faster.
		- Rotation rate ‚Äî faster rotation yields a stronger equatorial bulge (which enhances precession).
		- Internal structure ‚Äî core-to-mantle mass distribution changes the monon‚Äôs moment of inertia.
		- Gravitational interactions ‚Äî especially from moons or other monons in the system.

**Obliquity Azimuth ($\zeta_{n}$)**
- $\zeta_{n}$ ‚àà ‚ü®0¬∞ ‚àß 359¬∞‚ü© ‚Äî Measure of the *directionality* of the monons' obliquity relative to the periastron of its orbit.
- $\zeta_0$ is *defined* as the orientation when the planemon's northern hemisphere is tilted precisely away from the star or system **barycenter (·∏Ö)** (northern solstice) at periastron.
	- This is called ***periaptic zero***.
- $\zeta_{90}$ would indicate that northern solstice has *precessed* 90¬∞ around the monon's orbital path from **periaptic zero**.
- $\zeta_{180}$ would indicate that the northern solstice is occurring at *apastron*, the point in the monon's orbit *farthest away* from the star/barycenter.

- IMPORTANT:
	- For $\varepsilon_0$ monons (they have no axial tilt), $\zeta_x$ is *undefined*.

**Magnetosphere (radiation shielding) ($B_{surf}$)**
- $B_{surf}$ refers to the **surface magnetic field strength**, measured in **microteslas (ŒºT)**.
	- For Earth, the typical surface field ranges between **25‚Äì65 ŒºT**, depending on latitude and local crustal anomalies.
- $B_{surf} < 5 \mu T$ ‚Äî Unshielded; high cosmic radiation exposure, especially polar regions- 
- $B_{surf} \in \langle5 \wedge 20\rangle \mu T$ ‚Äî Minimal shielding; monon parahabitable without O‚ÇÉ layer and/or thick tmosphere
- $B_{surf} \in \langle20 \wedge 40\rangle \mu T$ ‚Äî Weak field; still protective but slightly more porous
- $B_{surf} \in \langle40 \wedge 70\rangle \mu T$ ‚Äî Comparable to Earth; effective radiation shielding
- $B_{surf} \in \langle25 \wedge 65\rangle \mu T$ ‚Äî Earth's typical magnetosphere strength range
- $B_{surf} \in \langle70, ..,100\rangle \mu T$ ‚Äî Significant shielding, but with growing secondary effects
- $B_{surf} > 100 \mu T$ ‚Äî Magnetosphere begins trapping too much radiation
	- Where the magnetosphere is concerned, there is such a thing as "too much of a good thing"; once the field strength exceeds ~100 ŒºT, the magnetosphere may begin to trap radiation instead of deflecting it ‚Äî causing the very problems it‚Äôs meant to prevent.
- $B_{surf} > 400 \mu T$ ‚Äî Gas giant strength; radiation belts around monon make space travel exceedingly hazardous.
- Why It Matters
	- A strong magnetic field deflects charged particles from the stellar wind, forming a **magnetosphere**.
		- Without this protection:
		    - **Atmospheric erosion** increases (especially from solar UV and wind)
            - **Surface radiation levels** rise, particularly in equatorial and polar regions
            - **Ozone layers** and other protective atmospheric chemistry can degrade
        - Mars is the cautionary tale: once magnetically active, its **core solidified early**, its field collapsed, and it lost most of its atmosphere to space.
- What Generates It?
	- A monon‚Äôs magnetic field typically arises from a **dynamo effect** ‚Äî the movement of **conductive fluid** (usually liquid iron) in its outer core:
	- Requires:
	    - **Electrically conductive material**
        - **Rotation** (faster helps)
        - **Active convection** in the core (driven by heat and composition gradients)
	- Influenced by:
	    - **Core size and composition** (metallicity)
	    - **Rotation rate (d)** ‚Äî faster rotation generally strengthens dynamo action
	    - **Internal heat flux** ‚Äî related to mass, age, and radioactive element content

# Continuation: Recommendations

We mentioned above that "... radius is the most flexible of the parameters...," and that's true, since we're treating radius as an emergent property of the other parameters, specifically mass and density.

**Gravity**, on the other hand, is really the *least* forgiving of the parameters *for Geotic worlds*.  But that deserves a moment's attention.  We've specified that:
$$g \in \langle0.5 \wedge 1.5\rangle\oplus\text{,}$$
but we didn't really explain *why* those are our bounds.  What *are* the physical and biological implications of going beyond them?  Let‚Äôs look.

> **Keppy**: But some life forms *might* still evolve on worlds like these...?

Yes, with the caveats listed above.  The point, here, though, is that while gravities outside the g ‚àà ‚ü®0.5 ‚àß 1.5‚ü©‚®Å range are *certainly* possible ‚Äî even *probable* ‚Äî and while life *might evolve* under these conditions, these worlds would be Tellurics in the *parahabitable* range, outside even *habitable*, and certainly not *hospitable to humans* which is our core criterion for **Geotic worlds**.

# Close-focus on Parameter Precedence
Elsewhere, I stated that

> "Radius is an *emergent property ‚Äî the most flexible of the five core monon parameters*."

Here, we learn *why* that's the case.

WCB defines five core parameters for modeling monons:
- Mass (m)
- Density (œÅ)
- Surface Gravity (g)
- Escape Velocity (v‚Çë)
- Radius (r)

## Physical vs Emergent Properties
The first two ‚Äî **mass** and **density** ‚Äî are fundamental **physical properties**. If an object is composed of a specific material (e.g., pure iron), then:
- Its **density** reflects the compactness of that material under standard conditions.
- Its **mass** is the product of that density and volume.
These values are not ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù ‚Äî they are *determined* by composition. But there‚Äôs a complicating factor:

### Uncompressed Density in WCB
In reality, high-mass monons **compress themselves** under their own gravity. This self-compression:
- Increases core pressure
- Reduces actual volume
- Nudges the average (measured) density *upward*
Unfortunately, the feedback between mass, gravity, and compression is:
- This feedback loop is **nonlinear**
- The corrections vary by **material type**
- And modeling it accurately requires **complex equations of state**
WCB intentionally avoids this complexity in favor of **practical worldcrafting**.

> **WCB Convention:**  
> We treat *œÅ* (density) as the **uncompressed density** of the monon ‚Äî the intrinsic density of its materials assuming no internal gravitational compression.

This keeps *œÅ* symbolically **independent** from *m* and allows us to calculate *r*, *g*, and *v‚Çë* without recursive modeling.  Compression effects are minimal within the Geotic range ‚ü®0.5 ‚àß 1.5‚ü©‚®Å, so this simplification is physically tolerable and worldcrafter-friendly.

### Parameter Precedence: A Symbolic Hierarchy
In WCB, we adopt a symbolic precedence system to clarify **what depends on what**.
#### First Precedence: Composition-Driven Parameters
- **Mass** (*m*)
- **Uncompressed Density** (*œÅ*)
These are **primary constraints**, based on:
- Material class
- Planetary category
- Biospheric plausibility
- Narrative or symbolic intention 

#### Second Precedence: Experiential Parameters
- **Surface Gravity** (*g*)
- **Escape Velocity** (*v‚Çë*)
These depend on *m* and *œÅ*, and describe how a being would **experience** the world. They answer:
- *‚ÄúHow heavy do things feel?‚Äù*
- *‚ÄúHow hard is it to launch something into space?‚Äù*
Because they‚Äôre **experiential**, *g* and *v‚Çë* serve as **thresholds for habitability** and **filters for narrative design**.

> For writers of SF, escape velocity might be of slightly greater import, as they are often more concerned with getting characters out of the monon's gravity well.

#### Third Precedence: Emergent Parameter
- **Radius** (*r*)
We treat radius as an **emergent quantity**, derived from the interplay between *m* and *œÅ*. Once those are specified, *r* is computed using:

$$
\begin{aligned}
r &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{3 m}{4 \pi \rho}} &&\qquad \text{Absolute Calculation} \\
r &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{m}{\rho}} &&\qquad \text{Relative calculation}
\end{aligned}
$$
By defining *œÅ* as uncompressed, we sidestep recursive compression modeling and free *r* to play its proper role as a derived result.

> **In short:** Radius is not arbitrarily assigned in WCB ‚Äî it emerges from first principles, and that‚Äôs exactly what gives it flexibility.

However, if a monon meets all other Geotic criteria but falls slightly outside the ‚ü®0.5 ‚àß 1.5‚ü©‚®Å radius guideline, **there is room for flex** ‚Äî especially when symbolic or experiential factors support it.

### Surface Gravity, Escape Velocity, and Radius "Flexibility"
We maintain the general **Geotic envelope** of ‚ü®0.5 ‚àß 1.5‚ü©‚®Å for all five core parameters. However ‚Äî as discussed in **Example: When Good Values Go Bad** ‚Äî not all combinations of any two parameters will yield outputs that remain Geotic.

To test this, we evaluated all combinations of **mass** (*m*) and **uncompressed density** (*œÅ*) within the Geotic range (‚ü®0.5 ‚àß 1.5‚ü©‚®Å), using an increment of 0.05‚®Å for each. From these, we calculated the corresponding:
- **Surface Gravity** (*g*)
- **Escape Velocity** (*v‚Çë*)
- **Radius** (*r*)

 #### Results from Evaluated Combinations:
- **Gravity** (*g*) ‚Äî derived from *m* and *œÅ*:
    - All values fell within the expected ‚ü®0.5 ‚àß 1.5‚ü©‚®Å range.
- **Escape Velocity** (*v‚Çë*) ‚Äî derived from *m* and *œÅ*:
    - Calculated range was ‚ü®0.7071 ‚àß 1.2247‚ü©‚®Å.
- **Radius** (*r*) ‚Äî derived from *m* and *œÅ*:
    - Calculated range was ‚ü®0.6934 ‚àß 1.4423‚ü©‚®Å.
**Conclusion:**  
All outputs for *g*, *v‚Çë*, and *r* computed from Geotic-range values of *m* and *œÅ* **remain within or closely near** the ‚ü®0.5 ‚àß 1.5‚ü©‚®Å constraint window.

> **Reminder:**  
> While *mass* and *density* serve as **primary constraints**, the values they generate for *gravity*, *escape velocity*, and *radius* are **emergent** ‚Äî and may push right up to the edges of Geotic acceptability. monons with marginal values on one or more of these outputs may still qualify symbolically, depending on biospheric or narrative justification.

## Order of Parameter Calculation
WCB allows you to begin with **any two** of the five core monon parameters and calculate the remaining three. For example:
- You might specify a desired **gravity** (*g*) and **radius** (*r*) to match narrative or symbolic needs ‚Äî and then calculate **mass**, **density**, and **escape velocity** from those.
However:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:**  
> **Mass** (*m*) and **uncompressed density** (*œÅ*) are treated as **inflexible physical constraints** in WCB. They must fall within the Geotic envelope ‚ü®0.5 ‚àß 1.5‚ü©‚®Å to yield plausibly habitable worlds.

### WCB Recommendation
> **Start with mass and uncompressed density.**  
> These two parameters:> 
> - Reflect the physical composition of your monon
> - Are symbolically independent
> - Guarantee valid outputs for *g*, *v‚Çë*, and *r* if kept within the Geotic range    

By anchoring your model in *m* and *œÅ*, you ensure that all derived parameters remain within acceptable bounds ‚Äî streamlining your creative process and avoiding invalid combinations.
