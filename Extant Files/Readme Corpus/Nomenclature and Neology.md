I call this system *Worldmaking*, because "worldbuilding" in the commonly understood sense has mostly to do with the *mythosic* elements: politics, religion, culture, language, etc.  But — depending on one's genre — sometimes a bit of science-adjacent rigor is necessary for verisimilitude.  The *logosic* elements: physics, cosmology, chemistry, mathematics, etc., must be given appropriate attention for the milieu to be internally consistent.  This aspect of the process I call *worldcrafting*.  Think of it this way... a carpenter making a cabinet first **craft**s the individual pieces and then **build**s the complete construct.

In that sense, **WCB** isn’t just a toolbox; it’s a **philosophy of world creation** that restores balance between *logos* and *mythos*.
