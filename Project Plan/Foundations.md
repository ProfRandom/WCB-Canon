# Foundations — World Crafting Basics

*World Crafting Basics* (WCB) is a practical toolkit for building internally consistent, believable worlds for fiction, games, and visual media.  

WCB is primarily a *how-to* system: it translates **cosmological principles** into design patterns you can use quickly and reliably.

**Key idea (short):**  
- Worlds in WCB are built around **coherence** — how matter and energy hold together and interact.  
- **Descriptive parameters** (mass, radius, luminosity, chemistry, etc.) are tools you use to shape believable results.

**What this guide gives you**
- Clear, reusable patterns for making planets, stars, systems, and cultures.  
- Step-by-step practical workflows (theory ↔ practice) for designing a world from first principles.  
- Minimal necessary background so you can design with confidence without needing advanced physics.

**Reader note:**  
If you want the deep philosophical and editorial rationale (the “why the system is organized this way”), see the private *Architect’s Appendix* (maintained by the compilers).  
The public corpus stays focused on craft and application.

**Practical workflow (high level)**

WCB operates chiefly within the **Cosmological Function** — the practical, interactive study of how worlds behave and can be designed.

1. **Decide a narrative effect** (what feeling or story you want).  
2. **Choose target results** (e.g., daylight level, day-length, climate class).  
3. **Apply the Ontic & Milieutic tools** (star selection, orbital radius, composition).  
4. **Validate** (stability, energy budgets, simple checks).  
5. **Embed** (culture, technology, myths — how inhabitants perceive and use these conditions).

For quick starts, browse the *Duramonic Practice* pages (planet-building recipes) or use the template **“Build a Planemon”** to get a finished-world spec in an hour.
