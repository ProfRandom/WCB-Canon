# Definitive Regimes
1. Ontics: being and coherence
2. Categorics: classification and relation

## Ontics — The Study of Being and Coherence

### Ontic Subfields

1. **Ontic Hierarchy** — Defines the structural grammar of being: monon, cule, lex, gate.  [[The Hierarchy of Ontic Systems]]
- The Ontic Hierarchy extends beyond individual bodies (*monons*) to describe how coherence manifests in larger, relational, and collective systems.

- **Monons** — the singular and self-coherent  
  - bound by *identity*  
- **Cules** — unity by *likeness* (homogeneous groups)  
  - e.g., duacules, multicules  
- **Lexes** — unity by *connection* (heterogeneous systems)  
  - e.g., stellalexes, duralexes  
- **Gates** — unity by *context* (collective or field aggregates)  
  - e.g., duagates, multigates, stellagates  

Each level marks a **mode of coherence**, not a scale of size — defining how monons combine to form higher 
3. **Ontic Classes** — Distinguishes types of self-coherent bodies: duramons, fusamons, peramons.  [[Ontic_Classes]]; [[Monon_Series_Mass_Domains]]
- **Ontic Classes**
  - **Duramons** — sub-stellar bodies  
    - *Planemons* — planetary-mass monons  
    - *Micromons* — asteroidal and small-body monons  
  - **Stellamons** — fusional, self-luminous bodies  
    - *Protostellamons* — forming or contracting stars  
    - *Main-Sequence Stellamons* — stable hydrogen-fusion stars  
    - *Poststellamons* — evolved or degenerate stars  
  - **Peramons** — trans-stellar and radiatively unstable bodies  
    - *Hyperstellamons* — extreme-mass fusion objects  
    - *Cryptomons* — collapse or exotic-state remnants  
3. **Ontic Regimes** — Identifies the dominant binding forces that maintain coherence at each scale.  [[Ontic_Regimes]]
4. **Ontic Metrics** — Provides descriptive parameters (mass, radius, density) linking Ontics to measurable physics. (eLink to [[Mazotic_Mass_Continuum]] )

> > **Ontics** — The definitive field of WCB that defines the existence and coherence of all self-bound entities (*monons*); it establishes *what is*, forming the basis for all descriptive domains.

**Ontics** is the definitive discipline within *World Crafting Basics* concerned with the **existence, structure, and identity** of self-coherent entities — known as **monons**.  

It defines *what things are*: how matter and energy unify into distinct, persistent bodies through natural binding forces — gravitational, electromagnetic, molecular, or nuclear.  

Ontics establishes the grammar of being across all scales, from the smallest cohesive particles to the largest stable bodies.  

It describes the **modes of coherence** — the ways entities endure, combine, and interact to form higher orders of unity.  

In the WCB framework, Ontics serves as the **foundation of all other domains**: descriptive fields such as Metrics, Morphotics, Conformics, and Animotics all depend on Ontic definition.  

**In short:** Ontics defines *what exists*; all other disciplines describe *how it behaves*.

## Categorics — The Study of Relation and Classification

### Categorical Subfields

1. **Taxonomics** — Establishes the principles by which ontic entities are grouped, ordered, or differentiated according to shared characteristics.  [[Categoric_Taxonomics]]  
2. **Systemics** — Describes relational and hierarchical organization among ontic entities, from binary pairs to complex networks.  [[Categoric_Systemics]]; [[Relational_Structures]]  
3. **Typologics** — Defines idealized archetypes or morphological patterns that recur across ontic and animotic systems.  [[Categoric_Typologics]]  
4. **Semantics** — Explores the interpretive and symbolic significance of classification — how categories shape understanding and narrative use.  [[Categoric_Semantics]]

> > **Categorics** — The definitive field of WCB that classifies and relates ontic entities; it establishes *how things are connected* and *what kinds of unity* they represent.

**Categorics** is the definitive discipline within *World Crafting Basics* concerned with the **relationships, groupings, and distinctions** among coherent entities.  
Where **Ontics** defines *what exists*, **Categorics** defines *how those existences relate*.  

It provides the framework by which worlds, systems, and organisms are **sorted, associated, or contrasted** — identifying the patterns that reveal order across scale and substance.  
Through Categorics, ontic entities become members of meaningful wholes: systems, families, and types.

Categorics thus functions as the **grammar of relation** — the logic of unity and diversity.  
It interprets the interplay of similarity, connection, and context that allows multiple beings to be understood as one structure, one lineage, or one system.

In the WCB framework, Categorics complements **Ontics** as the second definitive domain:  
where Ontics defines *being*, Categorics defines *belonging*.

**In short:** Ontics defines *what is*; Categorics defines *how it is related.*

# Descriptive Regimes
1. Metrics
2. Morphotics
3. Conformics
4. Animotics
5. Milieutics: contextual environment

## Metrics — The Study of Measure and Scale

### Metric Subfields

1. **Mass Metrics** — Quantifies ontic bodies by total quantity of matter or equivalent energy; defines standard units (Terran, Jovian, Solar).  [[Mazotic_Mass_Continuum]]; [[Metric_Mass_Units]]  
2. **Dimensional Metrics** — Measures spatial extent and proportion: radius, diameter, volume, surface area, and shape factors.  [[Metric_Spatial_Scales]]  
3. **Energetic Metrics** — Defines radiative, kinetic, and potential energy parameters; includes luminosity, temperature, and orbital energy.  [[Metric_Energy_Scales]]  
4. **Temporal Metrics** — Establishes periodic and chronological measures such as rotation, revolution, and systemic timescales.  [[Metric_Temporal_Scales]]

> > **Metrics** — The descriptive field of WCB that quantifies ontic entities through measure and proportion; it establishes *how things are sized, scaled, and compared.*

**Metrics** is the descriptive discipline within *World Crafting Basics* that provides the **quantitative framework** for all ontic entities.  
It translates the qualitative definitions of **Ontics** into **measurable relationships** — expressing coherence in terms of magnitude, proportion, and dimensional balance.  

Through Metrics, the physical properties of a body — its mass, radius, luminosity, or motion — become **numerically expressible** and **comparatively meaningful**.  
Metrics forms the bridge between the definitive and the descriptive: it does not define *what something is*, but reveals *how much of it there is*, and *how it relates to others by scale.*

In the WCB framework, Metrics serves as the **first descriptive domain**, grounding Morphotics, Conformics, and Animotics in quantifiable structure.  

**In short:** Ontics defines *what exists*; Metrics describes *how much* and *to what degree* it exists.

## Morphotics — The Study of Form and Configuration

### Morphotic Subfields

1. **Geometrica** — Describes the fundamental spatial geometry and equilibrium of ontic bodies: spherical, ellipsoidal, irregular, disk-like, or filamentary forms.  [[Morphotic_Geometrica]]  
2. **Tectonica** — Examines the large-scale structural organization and deformation within both solid and fluid bodies: layering, convection, differential rotation, or stratification.  [[Morphotic_Tectonica]]  
3. **Symmetrica** — Defines axes, planes, and degrees of symmetry or asymmetry across all regimes, from molecular lattices to stellar envelopes.  [[Morphotic_Symmetrica]]  
4. **Topologica** — Explores continuous and relational shape properties independent of scale or substance — such as connectivity, enclosure, or toroidal topology.  [[Morphotic_Topologica]]

> > **Morphotics** — The descriptive field of WCB that characterizes the form, structure, and spatial organization of ontic entities; it establishes *how things are shaped, arranged, and expressed in space.*

**Morphotics** is the descriptive discipline within *World Crafting Basics* that studies the **geometry, configuration, and equilibrium of form** across all scales of being.  
It describes *how coherence becomes shape* — whether through hydrostatic balance, rotational distortion, magnetic confinement, or field topology.  

Morphotics applies universally: to **duramons** (solid or rheic worlds), **fusamons** (stars in all stages of fusion), and **peramons** (collapse objects and exotic states).  
In each case, it interprets how forces and flows produce observable form — from spherical equilibrium and disk flattening to jet formation and irregular fragmentation.

By analyzing curvature, symmetry, and structural alignment, Morphotics reveals the **architectural logic** that unites the planetary, stellar, and galactic alike.  
It is the language of visible coherence — how existence appears through geometry.

In the WCB framework, Morphotics serves as the **second descriptive domain**, following Metrics and preceding Conformics.  
It transforms measure into form and coherence into configuration.

**In short:** Ontics defines *what exists*; Morphotics describes *how existence takes shape.*

## Conformics — The Study of Material State and Cohesion

### Conformic Subfields

1. **Phaseologia** — Defines the principal states and transitions of matter and energy: solid (lithic), liquid (rheic), gaseous (aeric), and plasma or exotic-field (ulsic).  [[Conformic_Phaseologia]]  
2. **Bondica** — Describes the dominant bonding mechanisms that determine internal cohesion: molecular, metallic, ionic, covalent, gravitational, or magnetic.  [[Conformic_Bondica]]  
3. **Thermodynamica** — Examines the interplay of temperature, pressure, and energy transfer that governs material stability and transformation.  [[Conformic_Thermodynamica]]  
4. **Structura** — Analyzes material organization within regimes: crystalline, amorphous, fluidic, particulate, or field-ordered structures.  [[Conformic_Structura]]

> > **Conformics** — The descriptive field of WCB that characterizes the material and energetic states of ontic entities; it establishes *how things are composed, bonded, and transformed.*

**Conformics** is the descriptive discipline within *World Crafting Basics* concerned with the **composition, cohesion, and transformation** of matter within self-coherent bodies.  
It defines *how materials behave and persist* under the conditions established by Ontic and Morphotic frameworks — how they melt, flow, ionize, or crystallize in response to energy and pressure.

Conformics applies across every ontic scale and regime:  
- to **duramons**, it explains the lithic and rheic structures of planetary crusts, mantles, and cores;  
- to **fusamons**, it defines the thermonuclear plasma and radiative stratification of stars;  
- to **peramons**, it encompasses degenerate and exotic matter — neutronium, quark-gluon plasma, and beyond.  

Through its study of phase, bonding, and thermal behavior, Conformics bridges the gap between physical law and tangible experience — the science of what matter *is doing* while it *exists*.  
It reveals the dynamic equilibrium that allows a body’s structure to endure, evolve, or collapse.

In the WCB framework, Conformics serves as the **third descriptive domain**, following Morphotics and preceding Animotics.  
It transforms form into substance — showing how the architecture of matter becomes the experience of materiality.

**In short:** Ontics defines *what exists*; Conformics describes *what it is made of and how it holds together.*

### Conformic Archetypes (Phaseologia)

> **Primary conformic archetypes** describe the four principal modes of cohesion expressed by matter across all ontic scales.  
> They are not separate ontic classes but recurring states of material organization, appearing in worlds, stars, and field phenomena alike.

| **Archetype** | **Description** | **Dominant Cohesion** | **Examples** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Lithic** | Solid, rigid, or crystalline matter. | Molecular or metallic bonding. | Rock, ice, crystal lattices. |
| **Rheic** | Fluid, molten, or viscous matter. | Dynamic molecular cohesion. | Magma, water, ammonia oceans. |
| **Aeric** | Gaseous, diffuse, or vaporous matter. | Kinetic and pressure balance. | Atmospheres, nebulae, gaseous envelopes. |
| **Ulsic** | Energetic, plasma, or exotic-field matter. | Ionized or relativistic fields. | Stellar plasma, aurorae, accretion disks, magnetospheres. |

> Each conformic archetype reflects a **mode of stability** within matter —  
> the balance between internal cohesion and external energy.  
> Many ontic bodies exhibit more than one archetype simultaneously (e.g., a lithic crust above a rheic mantle and an aeric atmosphere).

## Animotics — The Study of Vitality and Equilibrium

### Animotic Subfields

1. **Biochronia** — Examines the temporal and energetic conditions that permit vitality to arise and persist within ontic systems.  [[Animotic_Biochronia]]  
2. **Chemogenia** — Explores the chemical foundations of vitality: solvent systems, reactive media, and energy cycles across different conformic regimes.  [[Animotic_Chemogenia]]  
3. **Ecodynamica** — Studies the environmental interactions that sustain or constrain living equilibrium — planetary climate, radiation, and resource exchange.  [[Animotic_Ecodynamica]]  
4. **Phylogenetica** — Describes the organization, diversity, and adaptation of animota — how living systems replicate, evolve, and interrelate.  [[Animotic_Phylogenetica]]

> > **Animotics** — The descriptive field of WCB that investigates the origin, persistence, and diversity of vitality; it establishes *how coherence becomes self-sustaining and self-renewing.*

**Animotics** is the descriptive discipline within *World Crafting Basics* that studies the **conditions, mechanisms, and patterns of vitality** —  
how matter and energy organize into systems capable of metabolism, adaptation, and awareness.  

Where **Ontics** defines *being*, and **Conformics** defines *substance*, **Animotics** defines *continuance*: the equilibrium that maintains coherence through constant transformation.  

Animotics encompasses every form of self-organizing, self-sustaining system, whether carbon-based, silicon-derived, plasma-bound, or purely energetic.  
It treats life not as a single chemistry but as a **functional phenomenon** — a stable oscillation between order and entropy that endures within the boundaries set by Conformics and the opportunities permitted by Milieutics.

### Animotic Framework

Vitality within WCB is organized hierarchically:

- **Order** — The broad chemical or energetic foundation of life.  
- **Realm** — The environmental domain in which that order can persist.  
- **Province** — Regional or material expression of that vitality.  
- **Environment** — Localized conditions of adaptation and survival.

#### Principal Orders and Realms

| **Order** | **Realm** | **Examples / Provinces** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Biotic** | Geotic, Telluric, Rheic | Carbon–water systems (Gaean Province) |
| **Exotic** | Xenotic | Ammoniac, silicate, cryotic, plasmic provinces |
| **Incertic** | — | Latent, extinct, or unrealized vitality (ananimotic states) |

**Animotics** thus bridges physics and vitality — translating the structures defined by Ontics, shaped by Morphotics, and composed through Conformics into living equilibrium.  
It is the study of how the cosmos *breathes*.

**In short:** Ontics defines *what exists*; Animotics describes *what endures and lives.*

## Milieutics — The Study of Context and Environment

### Milieutic Subfields

1. **Astrogemetrica** — Defines the spatial and gravitational relationships among ontic systems: orbital structure, resonance, and systemic balance.  [[Milieutic_Astrogemetrica]]  
2. **Climatologica** — Examines energy distribution and atmospheric behavior within planetary and stellar environments: temperature gradients, seasons, and circulation.  [[Milieutic_Climatologica]]  
3. **Ecotectonica** — Describes environmental layering and interaction among geophysical, biological, and energetic systems: biospheres, magnetospheres, and field interfaces.  [[Milieutic_Ecotectonica]]  
4. **Sociotemporia** — Explores cultural and temporal milieus that arise from physical conditions — how beings perceive, adapt to, and mythologize their worlds.  [[Milieutic_Sociotemporia]]

> > **Milieutics** — The descriptive field of WCB that investigates the contextual environments of being; it establishes *where and under what conditions things exist, interact, and evolve.*

**Milieutics** is the descriptive discipline within *World Crafting Basics* concerned with the **contexts and environments** in which ontic systems reside and interact.  
It unites the physical and the experiential — describing how spatial geometry, energy balance, and ecological layering create the conditions that shape both matter and life.  

Where **Ontics** defines *what exists*, and **Conformics** and **Animotics** define *how it is made and lives*, **Milieutics** defines *where it belongs and how it behaves within a greater whole.*  
It treats context not as background, but as a living framework — the interplay of forces, media, and perception that gives meaning and continuity to existence.

Milieutics operates across scales:
- From **micro-milieus**, such as the local chemical or magnetic environments of an organism;  
- To **macro-milieus**, such as planetary climates, orbital architectures, or interstellar ecosystems.  
It recognizes that every structure, from a cell to a civilization, exists within nested fields of influence — spatial, energetic, and cultural.

In worldcraft practice, Milieutics provides the tools to construct believable **habitable systems** and **cultural responses** to their environments — completing the chain that links physical law to narrative experience.

In the WCB framework, Milieutics serves as the **final descriptive domain**, integrating and contextualizing all others.  
It transforms existence into experience — defining the space in which worlds are *lived.*

**In short:** Ontics defines *what exists*; Milieutics describes *where and under what conditions existence unfolds.*
