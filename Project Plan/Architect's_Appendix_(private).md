# Architect’s Appendix — WCB (private)

Purpose: hold the metaphysical, editorial, and classificatory rationale that informs the public corpus.  
Audience: compilers, advanced contributors, maintainers.

## 0. Canonical Statements
- *Primary axiom*: Being is coherence.  
- *Necessary but not sufficient*: Mass (stress–energy) is manifested by being; it does not define it.  
- *Definitive parameter*: Binding regime (dominant force of cohesion) defines the ontic identity.

## 1. High-Level Ontology
- **Ontics** (field): study of *ontons* — modes of self-coherence (duramons, fusamons, peramons).  
- **Categorics** (container): Morphotics + Conformics — form and material condition.  
- **Animotics**: vitality, emergent organization.  
- **Milieutics**: system & environmental context (stellamonics sits here as practical star/system design).  
- **Ontic Metrics** (former Mazotics): mass/radius/density tables, units (Terran ⊕), ranges for reference only.

## 2. Terminology Map (old → new)
- Mononics → Ontics  
- Monon Series → Ontic Regimes (or Ontic Bands) housed under Ontic Categorics  
- Mazotics → Ontic Metrics (reference tables in /Ontics/0_Metrics_and_Scales.md)

## 3. Functions & Pedagogy
- Four functions (concise definitions and recommended public treatment):  
  - Mystical (reactive): *mention only; inspirational*.  
  - Cosmological (interactive): *primary; full exposition & practice*.  
  - Transactive (applicative): *illustrative examples; ethics prompts*.  
  - Coactive (relational): *case studies, long-form scenarios*.

## 4. Ontic Architecture
- Ontons: Duramon, Fusamon, Peramon — canonical definitions, binding regimes, edge cases.  
- Ontic Regimes: table of bands (nominal mass ranges, common examples, dominant cohesion).  
- Subclassing rules: how micromons, minimons, planemons map to ontic regimes.

## 5. Categorics (Morphotics & Conformics)
- Canonical morphotypes (lithic, rheic, aeric, ulsic) — definitions, thresholds, cross-scale notes.  
- Conformic regimes and transitions (e.g., when lithic → rheic behavior dominates).  
- Mapping grid: {Ontic Regime} × {Morphotype} → likely Category/Envelope (duramonic envelope examples).

## 6. Milieutics (system design)
- Stellamonics (practicum): star parameters → habitable zone recipes.  
- System-architecture templates (single-star, binary variants, resonant chains).  
- Stability heuristics, habitability quick-checks.

## 7. Animotics
- Habitability constraints, biosphere archetypes, energy-flux budgets (practical, not deep biology).  
- Cultural consequences: heuristic probes for myth / technology (link to Reflexive Epistemics templates).

## 8. Epistemics & Reflexive Layers
- How in-world epistemologies form (templates for “how inhabitants interpret X”).  
- Reflexive templates: Fact → Perception → Interpretation.

## 9. Versioning & Editorial Rules
- Canon lock policy (what gets “locked in” and how).  
- Change log template for major revisions (date, summary, rationale, affected files).  
- Style rules (tone, equations, units).

## 10. Quick-reference Appendices
- Units & conversions (Terran, Jovian, Solar).  
- Common formulae (orbital radius–flux, simple gravity, Roche/Hill heuristics links).  
- Example build recipes (Build-A-Planemon: 5 recipes).

**Usage notes:** Keep the Appendix developer-facing. Public pages should reference it when necessary but never replicate lengthy argumentation. Use it as the authoritative source for any editorial decision.
