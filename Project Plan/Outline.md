# Canon Integration Plan — *Volume 4, 5e: Moons and Rings (Compiled)*

### Overview
The material in *Volume 4, 5e — Moons and Rings* predates the Mononic Taxonomy and the Parenson framework.  
Most sections are superseded by later Canon files. The following plan preserves only material of continuing canonical or design value.

## 🔶 Section Integration Map

| **Section** | **Current Status** | **Action / Integration Target** | **Notes & Purpose** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Part 1 — Historical Context of Moons** | Apocryphal | Archive to *Appendix C — Deprecated Models* | Retain as a short historical sidebar under *Binaries 7 — Parensons (Historical Concepts)* to show pre-Canonical classification ideas. |
| **Part 2 — Classification Systems** | Obsolete | Archive to *Appendix C — Deprecated Models* | Fully superseded by the Mononic taxonomy and genealogical framework (primogenic / consequent / syllipsic). Include a small comparative diagram only if needed for pedagogy. |
| **Part 3 — Designing Minor Moons (and Asteroids)** | Retain (with revision) | Integrate into *Monons 3 — Small Star System Bodies* | Update terminology: “minor moons” → *nodulic monons.* Keep physical modeling and compositional design guidance. |
| **Part 4 — Planetary Ring Systems** | Adapt selectively | Split between *Binaries 5 — The Roche Limit* and *Planemons 2 — Habitability* | Replace “major moon” phrasing with *spheric parenson.* Incorporate the “Ring Effects on (In)habitable Worlds” subsection into the habitability discussions. |
| **Part 5 — Moons and the Potential for Planetary Life** | Retain and Canonize | Integrate into *Binaries 7 — Parensons* | Keep intact. Aligns with *Stars 6 — Solar Analogs and Habitability.* Rename section “**Parenson Habitability and Tidal Influence.**” |
| **Part 6 — Ring-Moon Interactions and Habitability** | Redundant / Merged | Merge snippets into *Binaries 5 — The Roche Limit* and *Planemons 2 — Habitability* | Preserve only unique paragraphs on **ring-shadow albedo** and **atmospheric oscillation** for use in ring-geometry modeling. |

## 🧭 Editorial Notes
- The term *major/minor* is **deprecated**; use *spheric/nodulic* for morphology and *regular/irregular* + *primogenic/consequent/syllipsic* for genealogy.  
- All gravitational, tidal, and habitability discussions should reference updated equations and regimes from *Binaries 4–6*.  
- Any remaining historical terminology should be placed in **grey-boxed “Historical Context” callouts** when republished.
