# Vision

> **World Crafting Basi (WCB) proceeds from three simple assumptions:**
>
> 1. **Things exist.**  
> 2. **They are measurable and quantifiable.**  
> 3. **Their properties are describable in forms that make them abstractly manipulable.**
>
> The question of *why* stars and planets exist is a worthy philosophical pursuit,  
> but **WCB** is concerned with *what they are made of* and *how they behave*—  
> both in isolation and in interaction.  
>
> Its purpose is to render those physical realities **accessible, intelligible, and useful** to the world-builder.

# Mission

> **WCB assumes its users share a simple motive:**  
> to design **cool, believable worlds** for **cool, believable, relatable characters**—  
> worlds that feel alive because they make sense.  
>
> Its audience wants to know **what they need to know** to do just that:  
> not only the physical characteristics of a planet,  
> but also the **environmental and circumstantial factors**  
> that shape how life can arise, adapt, and thrive upon it.  
>
> *World Crafting Basics* strives to make that knowledge **accessible**  
> and those processes **practical.**
