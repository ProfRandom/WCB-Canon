As with all stars (even the most stable and long-lived) the Sun's luminosity has varied over its lifetime. Shortly after its formation, its luminosity was about $70\%$[^1] of its current value, and the luminosity has experienced an average increase of about $6.7\%$ per billion years to its present value. When the Sun was 1 billion years old, its luminosity was about $76.7$% of its current value of $3.828 \times 10^{26}$ W. Thus the habitable zone limits and the nucleal orbit of a star, all of which are *dependent upon its luminosity*, will also be different depending on its age, and vary as the star ages.

For instance, the habitable zones for the Sun on its billion-year birthday were:
$$
\begin{align}
H_0 = 0.500\sqrt{0.767} = 0.438 \\
H_1 = 0.750\sqrt{0.767} = 0.6578 \\
H_2 = 0.950\sqrt{0.767} = 0.832 \\
N = \sqrt{0.767} = 0.876 \\
H_3 = 1.385\sqrt{0.767} = 1.213 \\
H_4 = 1.770\sqrt{0.767} = 1.550 \\
H_5 = 4.850\sqrt{0.767} = 4.248 \\
\end{align}
$$
Compare these numbers with the semi-major axes of the Solar terrestrial planets: at that time, Venus was 0.066 AU within the optimistic habitable zone (it’s $0.027$ AU outside now) and Mars was within the optimistic habitable zone by $0.026$ AU. (Neither was within the conservative habitable zone.) The Earth was $0.124$ AU beyond the nucleal orbit at that time.

| Planet  | Orbit |
| ------- | ----- |
| Mercury | 0.387 |
| Venus   | 0.723 |
| Earth   | 1.000 |
| Mars    | 1.524 |
Thus, while Venus is demonstrably uninhabitable now, it is possible (perhaps likely) that it was a far more habitable planet 3.0 billion years in the past (especially if its rotational period were more-or-less what it is now) as is discussed in a Scientific American article by Shannon Hall from August 2016 titled “Hellish Venus Might Have Been Habitable for Billions of Years”.[^2]

## The Sun's Future 'Habitable Zones'
The Sun's luminosity will *increase* as it ages, pushing the habitable zone limits outward from where they are now. Because the rate at which the Sun uses up its hydrogen fuel increases as its temperature increases, its luminosity will grow by an average of $18.42$ per billion years going forward.

So, in about $600$ ka, the luminosity of the Sun will have increased enough that it will begin to have deleterious effects on Earth: CO₂ levels in the atmosphere will begin to drop, negatively impacting Earth’s flora. By 1 billion years from now, all complex Earthly life will be gone: the loss of plants will lead to the loss of herbivores, and consequently the carnivores which feed on them. Shortly after this time, Earth’s water will begin to evaporate wholesale, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect which will eventually bake away any and all remaining microbial life, as well.[^3]

By around 5.5 billion years from now (when the Sun is about 10 billion years old and nearing the end of its Main Sequence lifetime) the Sun's luminosity will have increased to about $2.02$ times its current value, yielding the following figures for the habitable zone limits and the nucleal orbit at that time:
$$
\begin{align}
H_0 = 0.500\sqrt{2.02} = 0.711 \\
H_1 = 0.750\sqrt{2.02} = 1.066 \\
H_2 = 0.950\sqrt{2.02} = 1.350 \\
N = \sqrt{2.02} = 1.421 \\
H_3 = 1.385\sqrt{2.02} = 1.947 \\
H_4 = 1.770\sqrt{2.02} = 2.516 \\
H_5 = 4.850\sqrt{2.02} = 6.893 \\
\end{align}
$$
So, by that time, Venus may very well be mostly molten, Earth will be desiccated and sterilized,  Mars will be just $0.103$ AU beyond the new nucleal orbit, and Jupiter (at $5.204$ AU), will be within the outer boundary of the parahabitable zone.

Thereafter, the Sun will enter its red giant phase and its luminosity will shoot up dramatically, as will its diameter, utterly engulfing Mercury and rendering Venus and Earth into hellish, lifeless balls of mostly molten rock.[^4]
