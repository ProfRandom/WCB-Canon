## Physical Properties of Planemos

There are five properties of planemos that can be thought of as _physical properties_ — insofar as they describe the planemo physically or a property of the planemo that emerges from the other physical properties.  These are:

1. ***Mass*** (m):  The total amount of matter present. (_Mass and weight are not the same — weight depends on gravity; mass does not_.)
2. ***Density*** (ρ):  The average amount of matter per unit volume — essentially, how tightly packed the planemo’s materials are. This depends on both composition (e.g. rock, ice, metal) and, for larger bodies, gravitational self-compression.
3. ***Radius*** (r):  The distance from the planemo’s center to its surface.  Technically, this is derived from the planemo’s mass and average density — but more on this in a moment.
4. ***Surface Gravity*** (g):  The strength of gravitational acceleration at the planemo’s surface — how strongly it attracts objects located one radius away from its center.
5. ***Escape Velocity*** (v): The minimum speed needed to completely escape the planemo’s gravity when starting from the surface — how much velocity is required to leave the planemo entirely.

These are all intricately interrelated in ways that are much more complicated than we need to account for here.  For instance, while **radius** _is_ derived from **mass** and **density**, it also matters how strongly the mass of the planemo is gravitationally acting on itself.  This causes ***gravitational compression***, which means that the matter is forced into a denser configuration than it would otherwise exhibit _if it were not under such intense gravitational pull_.  So, it is also true that **density** in some sense is derived from **mass** and **radius**.

Surface gravity and escape velocity are also very dependent on both mass and radius.  The farther a point on the surface of the planemo is from the planemo's center, the less gravitational attraction from the planemo it experiences, decreasing according to the ***inverse-square law*** (more on this later).  And the weaker the surface gravity, the less energy it takes to overcome it, so the lower the escape velocity.

For our purposes, it is reasonable to simplify things and say:

> Radius is an _emergent property_ of the interaction of mass and density.

... and not be too overly concerned about the subtleties.

>  **Keppy**: _Sed ego dico_, right?

Yes; this is our first official invocation of _sed ego dico_, "because I say".  No, it's not _entirely physically accurate_, but it's good enough for what we need to accomplish.

Mass and density are also dependent upon what materials the planemo is made of: most planemos are composed of several materials (rock, ice, liquid water, etc.).  Rock, itself, can composed of any number of more basic elements and compounds.

And all of these materials have their own inherent densities.  Water, for instance, has a density of about 1.0 g/cm³ (and is, in fact the _standard_ for material density in the metric system we're using.)   Iron, on the other hand, has a density of about 7.7 g/cm³  — almost eight times that of water.  So 1 kilogram of water takes up more volume than one kilogram of iron.

> There is an old riddle, which was a favorite of my maternal grandfather: "Which is heavier — a pound of iron or a pound of feathers?"  The trick to the question, of course, is that both _weigh_ a pound, but because feathers are less dense than iron, that pound (in its natural state) takes up far more volume than does the iron.
