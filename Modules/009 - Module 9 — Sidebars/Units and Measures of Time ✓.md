### Types of “Day”

An **ephemeris day** (**mean solar day**) is a unit of time used in astronomy and celestial mechanics defined as exactly 24 hours (86400 SI seconds).

Contrast this with an **apparent solar day (tropical day)**, is the time it takes for the Sun to appear in the same position in the sky, from one noontime to the next, and can be either as short as 23ʰ 59ᵐ 38ˢ (23.9938889ʰ) or as long as 24ʰ 30ˢ (24.5ʰ).  Long or short days occur in succession, so the difference builds up until mean time is ahead of apparent time by about 14 minutes near February 6, and behind apparent time by about 16 minutes near November 3.

A **sidereal day** is a unit of time used in astronomy and celestial mechanics. It is defined as the length of time it takes for the Earth to make one complete rotation on its axis with respect to the _fixed stars_, and is defined as:

·         86164.09053083288 SI seconds

·         23ʰ 56ᵐ 4.09053083288ˢ (23.93447192ʰ)

·         0.99726956632908ᵈ

A **stellar day** is Earth's rotation period relative to the International Celestial Reference Frame, defined by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), as:

·         86164.098903691 SI seconds

·         23ʰ 56ᵐ 4.098903691ˢ (23.93446959ʰ)

·         0.99726966323716ᵈ

A sidereal day is 99.9999902827% of a stellar day.  The sidereal day is slightly shorter than the solar day due to the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun.  The synodic period between them is slightly over 28000 calendar years.

The **synodic period** between the **_ephemeris day_** and the **_sidereal day_** calculates to almost exactly the **tropical year**.



… which calculates to only 0.265295200 seconds (1.00000000840688 times) longer than the actual value of 31556925.2507328ˢ.

The **synodic period** between the **_ephemeris day_** and the **_stellar day_** calculates to very nearly the **sidereal year**.

… which calculates to only 101.65737 seconds (1.000003221 times) longer than the actual value of 31558149.7635456ˢ.
