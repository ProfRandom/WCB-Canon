# A Little Background

## What Is A Planet?

Well, that depends on who you ask.  Offically, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), as of 2006, a planet is:

1. A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.
2. A dwarf planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite.
3. All other objects, except satellites, orbiting the sun shall be referred to collectively as small solar-system bodies.

This (in)famously demoted Pluto from full planet status.

Items 1c and 2c are the crux of the debate, specifically the criterion for having “cleared the neighborhood around its orbit”.  Some people find that specification too limiting, or even artfully chosen specifically to single Pluto out, since it resides in the inner regions of the Kuiper belt and has several near neighbors, whereas the full planets of the Solar system do not (not counting moons).

Tim DeBenedictis in an article[^1] at Space.com, makes a simple and compelling argument that the dividing line should be set more simply at objects of greater than 1000 km radius which independently orbit the Sun.  At 1000 km radius, he says, the materials of which a body is formed (be they rock, ice, or metal) will start to deform under their own gravity and the body will become spherical(ish).

His definition is rather simpler than that of the IAU:

1. A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the sun, and (b) has a maximum surface radius greater than 1,000 km (620 miles).
2. All other objects, except satellites, orbiting the sun shall be referred to collectively as small solar-system bodies.

I follow DeBenedictis’ suggestion (though with more generic terminology):

1. A *planemo*[^2][^3] is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around a star or stars, and (b) has a maximum surface radius greater than 1,000 km (620 miles).
2. All other objects, except satellites, orbiting a star shall be referred to collectively as *micromos*[^4] (small star-system bodies; SSSB — moons, asteroids, comets, etc.).

...and I add the following proviso:

3. A *world*[^5] is a planemo that possesses a surface and/or atmospheric environment that is either *habitable*[^6] or *parahabitable*[^7].

| So, a *world* is a *planet*, but a *planet* isn't necessarily a *world*? |![[Hippy-portrait.webp\|50]] 


Oh, Hi, Hippy!  I didn't know you were here!  Friends, this is Hiparistarchus Ptolemeus Galileopernicum (Hippy to his friends — though he pretends not to like the nickname).

Yes, Hippy; that is a very good distinction.  All *worlds* are *planets*, but not all *planets* are *worlds*.  That is a good way to remember it, thanks!

BUT... micromos _can_ be parahabitable.  Make sense?

| Though the use of artificial living environments, right?  But that would depend on the rest of the planet's conditions, wouldn't it?  I mean, if it's a lava planet, it would probably need airborne habitats, rather than surface ones? | ![[Keppy-portrait.webp\|50]] |

Aaaand, here's Keppy (Keplarius Braheus), right on queue.

Yes, Keppy; it can get to be a fuzzy definition — but that's really the fun of it.  You're not locked-in to a narrow set of choices... you can "fudge" as your needs require.

###### Terminology Roundup

 - *Planemo*: a **planetary mass object** (a term coined by Gabor Basri) in orbit around a star or stars that has a maximum surface radius greater than 1,000 km (620 miles).
 - *Micromo*: a **micro-mass object** — e.g. irregular moons, asteroids, comets, etc.; also called *small star system bodies (SSSB)*
 - *World*: a **planemo** that has a surface environment that is either **habitable** or **parahabitable**.
 - *Habitable*: a planet which is **immediately habitable** by humans; people from Earth could land there, walk out of their craft in their shirtsleeves, and start hiking around learning about the place, its wonders ... and its dangers.
 - *Parahabitable*: a planet that is **provisionally habitable** by human beings through the use of technology like atmospheric domes, pressurized subterranean habitats, etc., which are (a) on or below the land or water surface; or (b) suspended in the atmosphere by natural buoyancy or gravity-countering technology.  In other words, the habitat must be in physical contact with the planet — orbiting platforms do not render a planet parahabitable.
 	- In cases where either habitable or parahabitable apply, I'll often use the nomenclature *(para)habitable*.
