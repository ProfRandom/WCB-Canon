# Earth-like Planemos

## What Does That Even Mean?

Let's revisit the _physical properties_ of planemos:

1. ***Mass*** (m):  The total amount of matter present.
2. ***Density*** (ρ):  The *average* amount of matter per unit volume.
3. ***Radius*** (r):  The distance from the planemo’s center to its surface.
4. ***Surface Gravity*** (g):  The strength of gravitational acceleration at the planemo’s surface.
5. ***Escape Velocity*** (v): The minimum speed needed to completely escape the planemo’s gravity when starting from the surface.

###### Terminology Roundup

 - *Planemo*: a **planetary mass object** (a term coined by Gabor Basri) in orbit around a star or stars that has a maximum surface radius greater than 1,000 km (620 miles).
 - *Micromo*: a **micro-mass object** — e.g. irregular moons, asteroids, comets, etc.; also called *small star system bodies (SSSB)*
 - *World*: a **planemo** that has a surface environment that is either **habitable** or **parahabitable**.
 - *Habitable*: a planet which is **immediately habitable** by humans; people from Earth could land there, walk out of their craft in their shirtsleeves, and start hiking around learning about the place, its wonders ... and its dangers.
 - *Parahabitable*: a planet that is **provisionally habitable** by human beings through the use of technology like atmospheric domes, pressurized subterranean habitats, etc., which are (a) on or below the land or water surface; or (b) suspended in the atmosphere by natural buoyancy or gravity-countering technology.  In other words, the habitat must be in physical contact with the planet — orbiting platforms do not render a planet parahabitable.
 	- In cases where either habitable or parahabitable apply, I'll often use the nomenclature *(para)habitable*.
