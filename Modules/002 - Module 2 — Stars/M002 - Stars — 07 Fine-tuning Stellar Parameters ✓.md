# Stars — 2.07 Fine-tuning Stellar Parameters
## Standard Parameter Equations
The Standard Parameter Equations (see [[M002 - Stars — 02 Parameters ✓]]):

… _generally_ work well for most **Main Sequence** stars, but a survey of known stars in the Solar neighborhood —

> **Hippy**: "Wha–"

… *which is too complex and extensive to detail here* — suggests that *modest* adjustments to a couple of key exponents yield parameter equations that better reflect observed stellar characteristics. Since thesiastics prioritizes plausible-world construction over strict theoretical purity, these revised values offer better performance across the mass range of interest.
### Modified Parameters Table

**Notes**:
- The parameter relationship that changed from the previous table was $T ↔︎ M$, where the exponent increased slightly from $1.98$ to $2.0$
- The **major change** is the addition of direct calculation for the parameters to-and-from luminosity; these are included for the purpose of simplifying much of the math related to [[M002 - Stars — 08 `Sun-Like` Stars ✓]].
- **For *greatest accuracy***:
	- The exponent $7.6$ can be more precisely specified as $7.5778$
	- The exponent $3.8$ can be more precisely specified as $3.7889$
