# 📊 Coverage Index v0.1 — Volume 6: Time and Travel

Mapping of the legacy PDF sections against current Vault (WorldCrafting101-DEV, 216 files).  
Status: ✔ Revised | ❓ Partial | ✖ Not Yet Revisited  

---

## 1 — Time: Cycles of the Earth
- **Vault Matches:**  
  - `Modules/009 - Sidebars/Units and Measures of Time.md` → discusses types of “day”.  
  - `Harmonic Periods.md` → rotational/orbital cycle relationships.  
- **Status:** ❓ Partial — Some coverage of Earth cycles and time units, but no full rewrite. Needs integration of seasonal/diurnal cycles.  

## 2 — Non-Terran Time
- **Vault Matches:** None.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — No coverage of alien/extra-terran time systems or alternative chronologies.  

## 3 — Interstellar and Intergalactic Travel
- **Vault Matches:** None.  
- **Status:** ✖ Not yet revisited — No current coverage of relativistic effects, FTL conventions, or system-to-system travel methods.

## 📌 Notes
- Vol. 6 is **largely unrevised**; only fragments on time units exist in the Vault.  
- New material needed on:  
  - Framework for **non-terran calendars** (tidally locked worlds, binary systems, etc.).  
  - Treatment of **travel times and methods** (Newtonian, relativistic, speculative FTL).  
- Consider whether **intergalactic travel** belongs in WCB core, or if scope should remain system/stellar neighborhood–focused.
