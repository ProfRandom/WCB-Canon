Technically, any two orbits can host an asteroid belt between them.  In practice, orbital gaps less-than about 2 AU can be considered impractical for placing an asteroid belt.  Here is a practical guide to building a basic belt.

# Select Your Orbits
As I said above, technically any two orbits can have a belt between them, but realistically, choosing orbits with at least a 2.0 AU _gap_ (not interval) between them will work best.

## Identify Your
